Multi-purpose antioxidant that plays a role in fading skin discolorations
Also known to offer skin-calming properties
A precursor of hyaluronic acid (meaning it helps skin make its own HA naturally)
The derivative form (known as n-acetyl glucosamine) is considered more stable and effective
Can be produced synthetically to be vegan vs. pure acetyl glucosamine is typically derived from shellfish

Acetyl Glucosamine Description
Acetyl glucosamine is a multi-purpose antioxidant that has been shown to be effective in reducing visible discolorations (specifically in 2-5% concentration). It works particularly well for evening skin tone when paired with the B vitamin niacinamide. It can also help reinforce skin’s supportive elements and is known to be soothing.
One of the uniquely beneficial aspects of acetyl glucosamine is that it is a precursor of hyaluronic acid (meaning it helps skin produce its own hyaluronic acid content naturally). Hyaluronic acid is a fundamental component responsible for helping skin maintain hydration and elasticity.
Technically speaking, acetyl glucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide (simple sugar). Although pure acetyl glucosamine is considered more sensitive to stability issues, research shows a synthetic or bio-fermented derivative known as n-acetyl glucosamine has been proven to be more stable and highly effective. This is the type you’ll find in the Paula’s Choice Skincare 10% and 20% niacinamide treatments and RESIST eye cream. This form is also vegan (whereas pure acetyl glucosamine is typically derived from shellfish).
FYI: Following the correct INCI (International Nomenclature Cosmetic Ingredient) naming conventions n-acetyl glucosamine simply goes by acetyl glucosamine on ingredient lists, but you can always consult the brand to find out which form they are using.
At the time of this writing, the current assessment of acetyl glucosamine by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review is underway with the next meeting with their panel of experts set for September 2021. We will be updating the information as it comes, but preliminary data has shown concentrations as high as 8% acetyl glucosamine can be used in leave-on products without issue.

Synthetically derived

Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 Description
Acetyl hexapeptide-8 is a synthetically derived peptide that is used in a wide range of skin care and makeup products. Also known as agireline and acetyl hexapeptide-3, it, like all peptides, has water-binding properties and skin-restoring abilities. It is considered a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide, meaning it could have the ability to target expression wrinkles; however, that benefit has been overstated in certain cosmetics claims (it doesn’t replace in-office wrinkle-smoothing injectable procedures).
Studies on topical use of a moisturizer containing a 10% concentration of acetyl hexapeptide-8 have shown it does not penetrate beyond the uppermost layers of skin, even after several hours. That means it cannot affect factors in the underlying layers that lead to the formation of expression lines.
On the other hand, research has shown this peptide can penetrate further into skin if specific formulary steps are followed, including the type of emulsion (a higher water content showed greater penetration). As always, this demonstrates the importance of selecting well-formulated skin care products to add to your routine.

Adenosine Description
Adenosine is a water-soluble yeast-derived ingredient that functions as a good soothing and skin-restoring agent. It has proven anti-wrinkle benefits and is a safe, beneficial ingredient all skin types can use. Studies also indicate strong potential for soothing properties.
One of the particularly exceptional qualities of adenosine is that it’s a natural component of the body and its receptors have specifically been identified in skin cells, allowing for a direct connection and impressive effectiveness when applied topically.
In one study (conducted by L’Oreal) adenosine showed efficacy in as low as 0.1% concentration for improving deep wrinkles in the periorbital area (i.e. crow’s feet) as well as glabellar frown lines (known as the 11s between brows).
In 2020, the Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety concluded that adenosine was safe in concentrations of up to 1% in leave on skin care products.
Adenosine is described as a white, odorless, crystalline powder in its raw form.

But first, a bit of backstory… One of the more depressing skincare facts we can think of is how bad dietary sugar or high glycemic index foods (foods that turn to sugar almost immediately after eating them) are for almost every aspect of your skin. Chocolate cake, honey-drenched sweets, ice cream sundaes, bread pudding, and on and on (and we could go on and on) cause very bad things to happen to skin. UV light and air pollutants are attacking your skin from the outside in, and sugar is attacking it from the inside out. What’s the relationship between sugar and AGEs? Sugars quickly and strongly bind to proteins in the skin (proteins are the main building blocks of skin) forming AGEs that progressively and continually destroy many aspects of skin, especially elastin and collagen, the two substances that give skin its firmness and resilience. Once generated, AGEs begin a cascade of progressive damage that isn’t easy to stop or reverse. Research has also shown AGEs can cause abnormal melanin production that leads to the formation of brown spots and mottled skin discolorations. Another ironic acronym for this is RAGEs, meaning a receptor site for AGEs that induces unhealthy melanin production. Although sugar is certainly a major culprit in the skin-damaging creation of AGEs, so is something called the Maillard Reaction (MR). The Maillard Reaction is what happens when you cook any food and brown or blacken it with high heat. That means steaming or sautéing food without browning is far healthier for your skin and body. And chargrilling foods, especially meats, at high heat is even worse! Our apologies to those who prefer their steaks well done. While some skincare companies claim their products contain ingredients that can block AGEs from forming, that benefit hasn’t been supported anywhere in the research. In the meantime, while science is working on this insidious problem, eating a low sugar diet that’s rich in antioxidants, complex carbohydrates, and omega fatty acids is by far the best approach for younger-looking, healthy skin from the inside out (and when you put those ingredients on your skin it can help from the outside in too, it’s just not clear how much that helps control the visible effects of AGEs; however, a huge amount of research shows those ingredients to be beneficial for skin overall). What about the occasional sweet treat? Although we can’t change what eating refined sugars does to your skin (and yes, this includes so-called sugar substitutes like raw honey and agave nectar, both of which the body recognizes as simple sugars), we also realize that sweets play a role in the pleasures of eating and celebrating. The trick is to keep it in moderation, meaning an occasional, judicious indulgence rather than daily consumption of desserts, sugary sodas, and flavored coffee drinks, the latter of which can contain an alarming amount of sugars.

AHAs are derived naturally from various plant sources and from milk, but 99% of the AHAs used in cosmetics are synthetically derived. In low concentrations (less than 3%), AHAs work as water-binding agents. At concentrations greater than 4% and in a base with an acid pH of 3 to 4, these ingredients can exfoliate by breaking down the substance that holds dead skin together. The most effective and well-researched AHAs are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be effective. AHAs may sensitize mucous membranes. However, AHAs have been widely used for improving signs of aging, dry skin and an uneven skin tone, all of which lead to younger-looking skin. There is a vast amount of research that substantially describes how the aging process affects skin and that demonstrates that many of the unwanted changes can be improved by topical application of AHAs, including glycolic and lactic acids. AHA use can result in increased sensitivity to the sun, though wearing a sunscreen daily eliminates this risk. Note: AHAs are of little benefit when added to rinse-off products, as their contact with skin is too brief for them to function as exfoliants or absorb into skin.

Alcohols with low molecular weights—the bad-for-skin kind—can be drying and sensitizing. The alcohols to be concerned about in skincare products are ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol. The concern is when one or more of these are listed among the main ingredients; tiny amounts in an otherwise good formula aren’t a problem. In addition to being drying and sensitizing, these alcohols can disrupt skin’s surface layers. Alcohol helps ingredients like retinol and vitamin C penetrate into the skin more effectively, but it does that by breaking down the surface layers of skin—destroying the very substances that keep your skin feeling healthier and looking younger over the long term. Alcohols like SD and ""denatured"" immediately harm the skin, starting a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. A 2003 study published found that with regular exposure to alcohol-based products, cleansing becomes a damaging ordeal—skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding its surface layers. It also destroyed the substances in skin that help to naturally soothe and defend it against visible effects of environmental damage. If that weren’t bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes healthy substances in skin to literally self-destruct. The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin’s substances increased the longer the exposure to alcohol; that is, two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day, and that is only from exposure to a 3% concentration (most skincare products with denatured alcohol contain greater amounts than that). In short, for the healthy appearance of skin at any age, avoiding products that contain high amounts of the drying, sensitizing types of alcohol is a non-negotiable skincare must.

It can also be extracted from comfrey (taken from the roots and leaves) and is proven safe and effective because it does not contain the potentially irritating alkaloid compounds that occur in the comfrey plant. Despite the natural source of allantoin being safe, the type of allantoin used in skin care products is generally produced synthetically as this guarantees no impurities while sacrificing none of allantoin’s effectiveness. It serves as an effective soothing agent and has moisturizing properties, giving it value especially in products designed to treat sensitive or compromised skin. It can also help mitigate skin’s response to stronger active ingredients and is often included in formulas to help buffer any potential adverse effects. In cosmetics, it is used in concentrations up to 2%, but in clinical settings it can be used in greater amounts, where research has shown it can have an impact on healing. In the United States, it is FDA-approved as an over the counter (OTC) skin protectant in concentrations of 0.5–2%.

aluminum,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/aluminum.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Uncategorized'],Good,"Aluminum is the most common element on Earth. It's also a common source of confusion in terms of its presence in cosmetics, specifically whether that presence poses a health risk. The fact is, when you read ""aluminum"" on an ingredient list, it isn't pure aluminum—not even close.
Pure aluminum is not added to any skincare or makeup product. Rather, compounds (mixtures of aluminum), such as aluminum combined with other natural elements, are safety used in a variety of ways in personal care products, foods and medicines. These compounds contain only traces of aluminum, and in daily use over the long term are perfectly safe. Such ingredients actually contain less aluminum than what occurs naturally in plants, vegetables or even in the human body).
Here are a few examples of the most common aluminum compounds used as ingredients in cosmetics, and a brief description of what they are (as well as their global safety status).

aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride contain only trace quantities of pure aluminum. These are most commonly used in antiperspirant and deodorants (and some medications) with extensive safety records.
alumina is also not ""aluminum,"" but rather a combination of minerals that contain various mixtures of aluminum, silica, chloride or zirconium and oxygen. It is also known as ""aluminum oxide"" or ""aluminum hydroxide,"" and is used safely in cosmetics, medicines and medical devices.
magnesium aluminum silicate is refined from clay and often used as an absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It is unable to penetrate skin.
aluminum starch is made from a reaction of a plant-derived ingredient (starch), and often used as a thickening or absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It has an extensive safety record.

 In cosmetics, the minute quantities of aluminum present in such ingredients are not at risk of absorption, as it these ingredients are insoluble—they are physically incapable of absorption into the body. This is true of such ingredients, whether they are used in cosmetics or skincare/personal care products.
In fact, skin does not readily absorb cosmetic ingredients. It's actually quite challenging to penetrate the skin's outer layers with skincare or medical products—such formulas must be specifically engineered to allow ingredients to penetrate even the most superficial layer of skin.
Thus, aluminum or aluminum ingredients do not contribute to health risks, and a link otherwise has not been established. Quite the opposite, as the Mayo Clinic, The World Health Organization, the European Union and the FDA have all concurred that there is no linkage of aluminum in personal care products to other health risks.
Published literature and an overwhelming amount of research has shown that skin cannot absorb aluminum from these ingredients, and what is used is far less than what we are exposed to daily in the food and water (given aluminum is a natural element that's present all around us—whether we use products with aluminum ingredients or not)."

Antioxidant backed by research for fading discolorations and evening out tone
Can be derived naturally from plants (typically bearberry) or made synthetically
The pure natural form of arbutin is referred to as beta-arbutin
Synthetic versions (known as alpha-arbutin and deoxyarbutin) have been shown to be more effective
Colorless to faint yellow powder (as a raw material)

Arbutin Description
Arbutin is antioxidant that may be derived from plants (most commonly the bearberry plant) or made in a lab. The plant-derived form is known as beta-arbutin and the synthetic forms are alpha-arbutin and deoxyarbutin. Each is backed by research for addressing hyperpigmentation issues (i.e. fading dark spots and other discolorations), as well as improving skin’s overall radiance.
Arbutin’s main benefit comes from the fact that it naturally breaks down into hydroquinone (which is known to inhibit excess melanin). This allows it to even out skin tone and minimize blotchy/patchy spots that are caused by factors such as unprotected sun exposure.
Studies have shown the synthetic derivatives alpha-arbutin and deoxyarbutin are more effective in this regard than the pure natural form of beta-arbutin due to having better stability, longer efficacy, and no risk of sensitivity when exposed to human skin cells.
As a raw material, arbutin comes in powder form, with a colorless to faint yellow appearance.
The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety recognizes up to a 2% concentration of alpha-arbutin and 7% concentration of beta-arbutin as safe in facial skin care products.

Technical name for pure vitamin C
Proven to reduce wrinkles and discolorations
Helps boost the effectiveness of sunscreens
The most abundant antioxidant in skin
Very sensitive to light and air exposure

Ascorbic Acid Description
Ascorbic acid—also known as L-ascorbic acid—has the most research of any form of vitamin C when it comes to skin, and in fact is the most abundant naturally occurring antioxidant in our skin. Concentrations between 5–20% can improve numerous the appearance of signs of aging, including discolorations, wrinkles, and loss of firmness due to sun damage. Lower concentrations such as those between 0.3–2% also offer benefits, such as improvement of uneven skin tone, fine lines, and boosting skin’s antioxidant supply.
Ascorbic acid is also a powerhouse when mixed with other antioxidants, especially vitamin E, and is particularly great for evening out skin tone when used alone in higher concentrations, such as 15%, 20%, or greater. Vitamins C and E work together to keep each other stabilized and able to exert their benefits in skin longer.
In order to be most effective in higher concentrations, any water-based vitamin C formula’s pH should be 3.5 or lower. This helps improve stability and permeability of ascorbic acid, allowing it to do more than work as an antioxidant.
Ascorbic acid is a particularly vulnerable antioxidant when exposed to UV light and air, so it must be packaged to protect it from these elements during routine use. If not, its effectiveness will gradually become diminished to the point of not working at all. You will see this as discoloration from oxidation which causes the product to turn a copper to brownish color. For this reason, avoid any vitamin C (ascorbic acid) products packaged in traditional, open-mouthed jars or clear bottles.
Dropper-based dispenser-type packaging should also have air-restrictive capabilities to improve stability. And for maximum potency, it’s best to use a water-based vitamin C treatment within 3 months of opening. With once-daily usage, most people will find they go through their vitamin C product within a couple months.
Considered safe as used in cosmetics, ascorbic acid is also fine to use with retinol and niacinamide without any of these ingredients causing the other to break down or lose effectiveness beyond what would normally occur due to air and light exposure, which is why ingredients like these need to be routinely applied.

The glucose is derived from a natural starch source, such as rice, while the vitamin C portion is synthetic. When properly formulated and absorbed into skin, it breaks down to ascorbic acid, also known as pure vitamin C. Once absorbed, its breakdown to vitamin C is gradual, creating what’s known as a reservoir effect within skin. This leads to longer-lasting benefits. Sometimes referred to as AA2G, ascorbyl glucoside functions as an antioxidant and works well with other replenishing and antioxidant ingredients to preserve key substances skin needs to look smoother, brighter, and younger. Research on ascorbyl glucoside’s ability to improve uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation is encouraging but not as extensive when compared with the decades of research amassed for ascorbic acid; however, ascorbyl glucoside plus the B vitamin niacinamide is a viable combination to consider, and several skin care products pair these ingredients. Ascorbyl glucoside is typically used in concentrations of 2–5% when brightening dull skin and fading the look of hyperpigmentation is the goal. Products with higher concentrations are available, but comparative research with commonly used concentrations is lacking. Levels of 0.5% and above can provide antioxidant benefits and help neutralize the damage associated with exposure to airborne pollutants and other environmental threats. It’s considered safe as used in cosmetics, both rinse-off and leave-on. Ascorbyl glucoside is widely compatible with other cosmetic ingredients. Unlike the tight pH range ascorbic acid needs to be effective on skin, ascorbyl glucoside works between a pH of 5–8, with the lower end of this spectrum considered better due to being a close match to the normal pH range of skin.

Made by combining ascorbic acid with palmitic acid
Not considered as effective as pure vitamin C
Has a powerful synergy with vitamin E (tocopherol and derivatives)
Often used to help stabilize air-sensitive skin care ingredients
Also used as a food additive to improve stability of oils

Ascorbyl Palmitate Description
Ascorbyl palmitate is a stable, oil-soluble form of vitamin C that is made by combining ascorbic acid with a fatty acid known as palmitic acid. It’s also known as ascorbyl-6 palmitate, and it is effective up to a pH of 6. Pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) requires a pH of 3.5 or lower to work, making ascorbyl palmitate easier to formulate with.
Although ascorbyl palmitate has antioxidant benefit for skin, research has shown it doesn’t penetrate as well as pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and that its conversion to vitamin C isn’t as efficient as other forms (such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate). This helps explain why ascorbyl palmitate isn’t the leading form of vitamin C in products meant to address lack of firmness, wrinkles, and discolorations. Research has shown that a modified form of this ingredient, known as trisodium ascorbyl-6 palmitate 2-phosphate overcomes this conversion issue.
The palmitate portion of this ingredient lends it hydrating properties many other forms of vitamin C do not have.
Interestingly, although ascorbyl palmitate is considered a stable form of vitamin C, research has shown other forms possess greater stability and skin can more freely convert those forms to ascorbic acid. However, a comparative study showed that ascorbyl palmitate maintains adequate stability in different types of emulsions when it is encapsulated.
Ascorbyl palmitate is often used in skin care at amounts between 0.1–1% where its antioxidant ability helps stabilize more delicate ingredients, including pure vitamin C; however, it’s not impervious to breaking down with ongoing exposure to heat and oxygen, as data from multiple ingredient suppliers attests.
It’s considered safe in the amounts commonly used in skin care and makeup products.

Antioxidants (such as vitamin E and ubiquinone) also show promise for enhancing avobenzone’s photostability.This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.

Ongoing in vitro (Petri dish) and in vivo (on skin) research has shown that bakuchiol seems to have skin-restoring ability when applied twice daily, and that it may also have a brightening effect on skin. Research has also shown this plant ingredient has soothing and anti-wrinkle properties as well as helping to visibly improve skin color and tone. Bakuchiol is often touted as an alternative to retinol minus the sensitizing effects some people experience from retinol. The association between bakuchiol and retinol is because many of its benefits seem to mimic what retinol does; however, it’s important to distinguish that bakuchiol is not identical to retinol. It’s not an equivalent replacement any more than a blueberry is the nutritional equivalent of an apple. Science has revealed that bakuchiol interacts with many of the same areas in skin as retinol, sometimes by taking the same pathway, other times by going a different route but still leading to the same results, such as diminished wrinkles, improved elasticity, and smoother skin. In either case, we’re confident that bakuchiol is a promising, beneficial ingredients whose actions can complement and enhance what retinol does for skin. Research has confirmed that bakuchiol works best in concentrations between 0.5-2%. Amounts lower than that have not been shown to provide retinol-like benefits.

Barium sulfate may play a role in skin barrier recovery by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board revisited the safety of barium sulfate as used in cosmetics, where amounts range from 0.99%-37% in either rinse-off or leave-on products. The Board determined barium sulfate is safe and non-sensitizing provided it’s formulated to be non-irritating (meaning the finished ingredient does not contain irritating salts from sulfuric acid). As the synthetic form of barium sulfate is what’s available for use in cosmetics, there is, quite literally, no need to be concerned that it might irritate skin; however, as with any cosmetic ingredient, an individual allergic reaction could still occur (although this is considered rare).

An organic alcohol that can be found naturally in some fruits
Serves chiefly as a preservative in cosmetics products

Benzyl Alcohol Description
Benzyl alcohol is an organic alcohol that occurs naturally in some fruits (such as peaches, apricots, and cranberries) as well as teas. Recent studies have found topically applied benzyl alcohol might help wound healing by promoting collagen production, however this is not its primary function in cosmetics products. Its chief function in cosmetics is as a preservative, and it’s among the least sensitizing preservatives in use. Benzyl alcohol works well as a preservative because it has both antibacterial and antifungal properties.
High amounts of benzyl alcohol can impart a noticeable floral-like scent to products, as it is part of the fragrance makeup of some essential oils such as jasmine.
As a volatile alcohol, it can pose a risk of sensitivity when used in high amounts but is considered safe as used in cosmetics (usually in concentrations up to 5%, and it may be used up to 10% in hair dyes).

Proven track record of safety

Beta-Glucan Description
Beta-glucan is a polysaccharide (complex sugar) that can be derived from various natural sources such as yeast, fungi, seaweed, or oats. It is commonly included in skin care products as a soothing agent and is considered an excellent ingredient for minimizing redness and other signs of sensitive skin.
Beta-glucan also offers antioxidant properties and has been shown to help visibly minimize signs of aging/sun damage (including reducing the look of wrinkle depth and rough, uneven tone). Certain sources of beta-glucan also offer film-forming moisturizing properties.
In early research, it was hypothesized that beta-glucan’s high molecular weight would inhibit it from penetrating skin, thereby limiting its benefits to just the surface, but in more recent studies, beta-glucan has been proven to permeate skin by passing between cells.
In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed beta-glucan as safe in cosmetic formulations in the present practices of use at a 1% max concentration.

Although betaine salicylate appears to be promising, there’s no independent research to go on, and no independent studies comparing its effectiveness to the well-established BHA ingredient salicylic acid.The only research about betaine salicylate comes from Arch Personal Care Products, an ingredient manufacturer that sells this ingredient. According to their information based on in vivo testing, betaine salicylate shows comparable effectiveness to salicylic acid at double the concentration. So, in seems that in order to get the same results from betaine salicylate as a product with 2% salicylic acid, a 4% concentration of betaine salicylate is necessary.Interestingly, like salicylic acid, betaine salicylate’s effectiveness is pH-dependent, with a pH range of 3.8-4.2 being needed.Anecdotal information from consumers who’ve tried products with betaine salicylate and salicylic acid is mixed; some people report better results and tolerability with betaine salicylate, while others report that salicylic acid worked better, without any unwanted effects. Our advice? Unless you know your skin cannot tolerate or doesn’t respond well to leave-on exfoliants with salicylic acid, there’s little reason to seek out an exfoliant with betaine salicylate. However, if you live in a country where salicylic acid’s use in skincare is unusually restricted, betaine salicylate exfoliants are worth checking out, but be sure the concentration is at least 4%."

Famous skin-soothing ingredient
Often included as a calming agent in bio-active formulas or products designed for sensitive skin

Bisabolol is a colorless to light yellow, oily liquid

Bisabolol Description
Bisabolol is a well-known skin soothing agent. It comes in two different structural forms: alpha-bisabolol, derived from chamomile and other plants (although it can also be lab-created) vs. beta-bisabolol which is found in cotton and corn. The alpha form is the one used in skin care products.
Bisabolol is commonly found in many personal care products, including moisturizers, cleansers, and serums. It often plays a bio-active skin-calming role thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties and shows up in many products designed for sensitive skin.
Beyond its soothing properties, research indicates bisabolol may offer some discoloration-fading capabilities.
The naturally sweet, slightly floral scent of bisabolol means it is sometimes used in higher amounts to impart fragrance to a formula. However, in lower amounts it doesn't impart much, if any, scent and its soothing compounds easily outweigh any risk of irritation.
Because bisabolol is typically derived from chamomile, and chamomile is a member of the ragweed family, it may be best to avoid it if you have a confirmed allergy to ragweed.
As a raw material, bisabolol is a colorless to light yellow, oily liquid.
In 2017, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review council concluded that bisabolol is safe used up to 1% concentration in leave-on formulations.

Some cosmetic companies claim that bismuth oxychloride is natural and better for skin than talc. The truth is that in many ways talc is a more natural, unadulterated, pure ingredient than bismuth oxychloride. Bismuth oxychloride, which seldom occurs in nature, is manufactured by combining bismuth, a by-product of lead and copper metal refining, with chloride (a chlorine compound) and water. It's used in cosmetics because it has a distinct shimmery, pearlescent appearance and a fine white powder texture that adheres well to skin. Bismuth oxychloride is heavier than talc. Pure bismuth is a naturally occurring, grayish-white powder. It and its derivatives are used as skin protectives, thickeners, and absorbent agents. Bismuth oxychloride was permanently listed by the FDA as a coloring agent in 1977 and for use as a synthetic ingredient.Some people react to bismuth oxychloride due to its unique crystalline structure. What happens is that the crystals can ""poke"" at skin and get stuck in the pores, where the sharper ""spokes"" can cause irritation.

Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract Description
Boerhavia diffusa root extract comes from the plant family Nyctaginaceae. While the plant itself has a long history of use in ayurvedic practices and traditional medicine, less has been known about its proven topical benefits for skin until more recent years. Of note, studies show the root extract possesses skin-soothing properties and antioxidant capabilities.
Boeravinone B, a component of Boerhaavia diffusa root extract, also shows promise for correcting the look of skin discolorations (i.e. hyperpigmentation and dark spots) for a more uniform complexion. To achieve this benefit, it is recommended that Boerhaavia diffusa root extract be used in 1-3% concentration.
Other potentially beneficial compounds of Boerhavia diffusa root extract include its amino acids (alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, proline, serine, and glycine just to name a few) which help contribute to skin’s natural moisturizing factor (NMF), key to balanced hydration.
While official research on Boerhavia diffusa root extract’s safety as a cosmetic ingredient is lacking, its track record of research for safe oral administration is a good sign.
Note: Boerhavia diffusa also goes by the spelling of Boerhaavia diffusa. It is sometimes referred to by its Sanskrit name of “punarnava”. The plant can be found in the tropics and subtropics but is native to India. The roots of Boerhavia diffusa are woody, with a pale yellow to brown color.

Current FDA regulations state that in order for any SPF-rated product to make a broad spectrum claim, it must pass what's known as a critical wavelength test and have the required testing done to confirm its SPF rating is 15 or greater. Any SPF-rated product below SPF 15 can only make a broad spectrum claim that applies to sunburn prevention, not skin aging (wrinkles, brown spots) or skin cancer.
The new labeling will also tell consumers on the back of the product that sunscreens labeled as both “Broad Spectrum” and “SPF 15” (or higher) not only protect against sunburn, but, if used as directed with other sun protection measures, can reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. For these broad spectrum products, higher SPF (Sun Protection Factor) values also indicate higher levels of overall protection. By contrast, any sunscreen not labeled as “Broad Spectrum” or that has an SPF value between 2 and 14, has only been shown to help prevent sunburn.
Sunscreen products that are not broad spectrum or that are broad spectrum with SPF values from 2 to14 will be labeled with a warning that reads: “Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.

Research indicates butylene glycol not only helps raise water content in skin (aka hydration) but may also contribute to decreasing roughness on the surface of skin (depending on how it's combined in the formula). While not known as a preservative in and of itself, some of butylene glycol’s properties can help boost a formula’s stability against microorganisms that may harm skin’s surface.  As a raw material, butlyene glycol is a clear and viscous liquid. It is similar to propylene glycol but has a lighter texture. It is used in a wide range of concentrations, with reports of up to 50%, although many suppliers cap it at 30%. The minimum amount tends to hover around 0.5%, in which case it's typically part of a blend with plant extracts and/or preservatives.  The Cosmetic Ingredient Review board has evaluated several toxicology tests and other research concerning butylene glycol over the years and has determined it is safe within the wide concentration range currently used in cosmetics products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has even determined that butylene glycol is safe as a food additive.

butylparaben,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/butylparaben.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],Good,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

Saponification is a process where alkaline ingredients are combined with glycerin and fats to create soap. Generally, unsaponifiable portions of butters and oils are not included in soaps because they have greater value in products meant to be left on skin. The unsaponifiable compounds in shea butter include vitamin E (tocopherol), sterols, and potent antioxidant compounds research has shown have excellent soothing benefits. These qualities make Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) unsaponifiables ideal for nurturing very dry or compromised skin and lips. The typical usage level of this concentrated ingredient is between 1–5%; however, skin care brands may use more or less depending on the desired aesthetics and benefits of a given formula. As an example, this form of shea butter lends a smooth texture to products which enhances application. This shea butter-derived ingredient is considered safe as used in cosmetics.

Popular emollient (skin-softening, moisture-sealing) ingredient
Often used in sunscreens where it keeps active ingredients evenly dispersed throughout the formula
May also boost the SPF of certain sunscreen actives
Can impart a lightly conditioning, silky finish to products
Proven track record of safety in cosmetic use

C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate Description
C12-15 alkyl benzoate is used as an emollient (skin-softening, moisture-sealing), texture-enhancing and dispersing agent in cosmetics. This common, synthetic ingredient is an ester that’s soluble in oil and oil-like ingredients, and imparts a lightly conditioning, silky, non-oily finish to products.
C12-15 alkyl benzoate’s excellent solubility is one of the main reasons it’s used in so many sunscreens, as it helps keep the active ingredients evenly dispersed throughout the formula. Research also indicates it has the ability to boost the SPF of certain sunscreen actives.
Another advantage of C12-15 alkyl benzoate is its occlusive properties which help skin retain moisture over a longer period compared to some other emollients that deliver shorter-lived results.
In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed C12-15 alkyl benzoate as safe in the reported use/max concentration at that time (up to 59% in leave-on products).

It’s often included in skincare products with claims that it will improve the look of cellulite or puffy eyes. Unfortunately, research into caffeine’s effects in this regard are mixed. Caffeine’s popularity in products related to cellulite is due to its distant relationship to aminophylline (an ingredient once thought to improve the look of cellulite), which is a modified form of theophylline, and caffeine contains theophylline.Applied to skin, caffeine may have soothing and antioxidant properties, especially when skin is exposed to UV light. It can penetrate skin and has a constricting effect, which can help improve the look of redness but also may be sensitizing.When it comes to puffy eyes, there is no research indicating caffeine can have any benefit; in fact, research has shown caffeine has an inhibitory action on a key protein in skin that helps it look younger.

It also intercepts collagen-degrading enzymes before they lead to visible signs of aging such as wrinkles and orange peel-like skin texture. At the same time, this plant extract addresses loss of collagen that can visibly impact pore size. Along with offering antioxidant and pollution-neutralizing benefits on its own, topical application of Camellia japonica flower also boosts the presence of several antioxidant enzymes that naturally occur in skin, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. This helps skin better defend itself against external aggressors that detract from a healthy appearance. This plant is also a rich source of the oil-soluble antioxidant gallic acid that defends skin against visible signs of UVB damage while also interrupting excess melanin production.

Although listed on a cosmetic product by the approved name of cannabidiol, this ingredient is commonly referred to as CBD. Cannabidiol is one of numerous cannabinoids found primarily in the Cannabis species of plants. It occurs naturally in the flowering tops of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa) but not in hemp seeds. Products that contain hemp seed oil that tout it as the source of cannabidiol most likely do not contain this substance (especially if you don’t see it listed among the product’s ingredients); however, it is possible to grow CBD-enriched hemp, where meaningful amounts of the cannabidiol is found in multiple parts of the plant. Confusing? Absolutely, which is why it’s important to only purchase CBD skin care from a trusted brand. Cannabidiol has been shown to offer numerous benefits related to calming skin. Skin has specific receptor sites for cannabinoids (referred to as its endocannabinoid system). It seems CBD can “talk” to these receptor sites on skin, sending unique signals to stop firing the wrong messages, which in turn leads to healthier, better-looking skin. This benefit makes cannabidiol an intriguing ingredient for interrupting the progression of damage within skin’s uppermost layers that can lead to visible problems; however, more research needs to be done to gain a greater understanding of how CBD works on skin. Research has also shown, though isn’t entirely clear on how this works, that CBD seems to visibly reduce oily skin. It’s also a very good antioxidant, on par with vitamins C and E. A quick note on the other compound in Cannabis that’s often mentioned, and that’s THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). This is the cannabinoid in marijuana (Cannabis indica) that has psychoactive effects (gets you high). The cannabidiol in skin care products must be THC-free, which means it contains 0.3% or less of this chemical, an amount lawmakers have deemed safe and unable to produce any sort of “high.” Last, the legal status of CBD in skin care (meaning for topical use only, not ingestion) appears to be on solid footing for now, but it’s a changing landscape that is being examined with an aim on clarifying its usage for consumers.

Caprylic/capric triglyceride can also function as a thickener or penetration enhancer, but its chief job is to moisturize and replenish skin.

Despite what is often purported on the internet skin care advice sites, there is no research showing caprylic/capric triglyceride is “comedogenic” or pore clogging. (This assumption is often tied to its relation to coconut oil.)

capryloyl salicylic acid,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/skin-soothing/capryloyl-salicylic-acid.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,"['Skin-Soothing', 'Exfoliant']",Best,"Capryloyl salicylic acid is a derivative (ester) of salicylic acid developed by L’Oreal. In chemistry circles, it’s known as 2?hydroxy?5?octanoyl benzoic acid, but skin care consumers most likely know it has lipohydroxy acid (LHA). The “lipo” portion is oil-soluble, although so is regular salicylic acid. To date, studies haven’t shown capryloyl salicylic acid is superior to salicylic acid; however, we know that LHA has a larger molecular size and along with its fatty acid structure has been shown to penetrate the skin slower than salicylic acid. In vitro studies have shown LHA tends to stay within the stratum corneum (the outermost layers of skin), while salicylic acid penetrates up to 58% further. This limitation may explain why capryloyl salicylic acid is not considered as effective for acne as salicylic acid. Speaking of acne, there is comparative research showing capryloyl salicylic acid used with benzoyl peroxide and/or a topical antibiotic produced slightly better results than using benzoyl peroxide and the topical antibiotic alone. While that’s encouraging, if you’re struggling with acne, regular salicylic acid should remain your go-to exfoliant. Just like salicylic acid, the capryloyl derivative has exfoliating and soothing properties as well as documented improvement in skin tone, wrinkles, and clogged pores. It also has the same formulary requirements around the pH range it works best, although unlike salicylic acid, in skin care LHA’s concentration is typically no greater than 1%. Interestingly, comparative research hasn’t focused on salicylic acid; instead, the single study that exists compared capryloyl salicylic acid to the alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) glycolic acid. In such instances, lower amounts (5-10%) of capryloyl salicylic acid were shown to produce an equivalent to superior level of visible improvement compared with much greater (20-50%) concentrations of glycolic acid. Due to the natural calming properties salicylic acid has, it wasn’t surprising that the LHA peels were perceived as less irritating than the AHA peel. Capryloyl salicylic acid is generally considered safe when used as directed. Note: Although studies on this ingredient were generally well done and followed scientific principles, it’s worth noting that all of them were either done by, funded by, or otherwise supported by L’Oreal.

Carnosine Description
As a skin care ingredient, carnosine is a synthetic peptide that is biomimetic, meaning it is designed to emulate the natural carnosine found in the body where it functions as a protein building block (the carnosine peptide contains the amino acids histidine and alanine). Topically applied, carnosine has skin-soothing and antioxidant properties that allow it to protect against oxidative stress and perform anti-aging capabilities.
There is some research indicating carnosine offers antiglycation properties. (Glycation is a process that leads to wrinkles, so warding it off is a good thing.) Manufacturer studies also tout carnosine’s ability to boost collagen, but as is generally the case for peptides, specific formulary considerations and delivery systems have to be in place for carnosine to effectively reach where it would need to go to have that effect.
Since carnosine occurs naturally in the body and plays a role in maintaining health, it is considered safe for topical use. The general range considered effective for use in skin care is anywhere between 0.05–2%.
Aside from topical skin care, carnosine is commercially available as a dietary supplement, where it shows promise for improving various health conditions.

Ceramides are necessary for their water-retention capacity and adding them to a skincare product helps provide replenishing and restoring benefits. Nine different ceramides have been identified in skin, some of which are used in skincare products. On a skincare product ingredient label, you’ll see those listed as ceramide AP, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide NS, phytosphingosine, and sphingosine.  The ceramides used in skincare products typically are derived from plants (wheat germ is a common source) or are synthetic; there’s no research showing that either form is preferred over the other.

It can be derived naturally, as in coconut fatty alcohol, or made synthetically. Unlike the skin-aggravating/drying forms of alcohol (typically listed as SD alcohol, denatured alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol), cetearyl alcohol is an emollient that is gentle, safe, and good for skin. Beyond cetearyl alcohol’s emollient ability to provide a softening and smoothing effect, it is also used as a carrying agent for other ingredients. Additionally, it can be used to alter the thickness of a formula or to influence the foaming capacity of a cleanser. It is almost always combined with similar-feeling ingredients to create a product’s texture and slip sensation when applied to skin. According to the U.S. FDA, cosmetic products labeled ""alcohol free"" are allowed to contain cetearyl alcohol, because the effects are so different from skin-damaging forms of alcohol. We repeat: fatty alcohols like cetearyl alcohol do not pose a risk of sensitizing or drying out your skin. As a raw material, cetearyl alcohol is a white, waxy solid (often in flake form). It is not soluble in water but is soluble in alcohol and oils. In the majority of skin care formulas, cetearyl alcohol is present in under a 5% concentration, although higher amounts are permissible. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review has a long history of recognizing cetearyl alcohol as safe in the present practices of use.

Cholesterol Description
Cholesterol is a natural component of skin’s barrier, accounting for 15% of its fatty acid content. Research shows that a deficiency of cholesterol in skin can lead to dryness. When cholesterol is applied to skin topically, it plays a replenishing role to support the moisture balance and lipid composition for healthier looking/feeling skin. Reinforcing skin’s outermost layers in this way also helps it resist damage from external stressors (think harmful bacteria, pollutants, etc.).
In skin care formulas, cholesterol can also function as a stabilizer, emollient, surfactant, and water-binding agent.
Cholesterol-enriched skin care products may list “cholesterol” on the ingredient label. Alternatively, if you see wool extract or lanolin on the ingredient list, know that these are sources of cholesterol as well. In addition, scientists are continually exploring ways to create synthetic ingredients that mimic cholesterol’s skin benefits.
The safety of cholesterol in skin care products has been assessed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel, who deemed it was safe in normal cosmetic use (studied in concentrations up to 5%, although they acknowledged most formulations they looked at contained cholesterol in the 0.1-1% range.) As with any natural fatty acid or oil, cholesterol is prone to going rancid with prolonged exposure to light and air so protective packaging is key.

Citric Acid Description
Citric acid is an extract derived from citrus fruits and is used primarily in small amounts to adjust the pH of products to prevent them from being too alkaline or basic.
Citric acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and as such, in the right formula and concentration, it can exfoliate skin. However, research on this ability so far has looked at much higher concentrations (20%, for example) than are typically used in skincare products—not to mention there’s proportionately more research on AHAs glycolic and lactic acids. Moreover, the AHAs lactic and glycolic acid have been shown to be more effective and less likely to promote a stinging reaction on skin.

Gentle cleansing ingredient used in face and body washes
Can be naturally derived or synthetic
Helps increase the lathering or foam effect in cleansers
Manufacturing impurities, not the ingredient itself, are the cause of sensitization responses

Cocamidopropyl Betaine Description
Cocamidopropyl betaine is a gentle surfactant used in skin care products, mainly face and body washes, that is almost always employed as a secondary cleansing agent, sometimes referred to as a co-surfactant. When used alone as the sole cleansing agent, it is generally too mild to clean adult skin and hair but is sometimes used as the sole cleansing agent in products for children. In any rinse-off formula, it also helps increase the lather or foam effect of cleansers.
Cocamidopropyl betaine may be plant-derived (most often from coconut) or synthetic, with either form considered safe for use in cosmetic products. It is considered low risk for sensitizing skin, although impurities resulting from poor manufacturing – and not cocamidopropyl betaine itself - increase the risk, emphasizing the importance of selecting well-formulated skin care products.
Cocamidopropyl betaine is approved for use up to 3% in leave-on products but its concentration range for rinse-off formulas is much wider, typically between 4–40% depending on the formula’s characteristics.

Due to its antioxidant activity, cucumber is a welcome addition to anti-aging products.
Cucumber contains fragrant components that are not sensitizing to skin (a rarity) so it can be used to enhance the natural scent of a cosmetic product without issue.
While this ingredient is often reported to be useful for improving the appearance of puffy eyes there is not adequate, reliable research to support this contention.
In case you’re wondering: The act of placing slightly chilled cucumber slices over the eye may help reduce puffiness, but that’s not because the cucumber has de-puffing properties. Rather, it’s the coolness of it that diminishes puffiness and constricts the skin, and cucumber slices just happen to fit the contours of the eye area.

Enhances the silky-smooth spreadabilty and sensorial feel of a product

Also functions as a solvent to dissolve and deliver ingredients to skin

Cyclopentasiloxane Description
Cyclopentasiloxane is often included in skin care formulations to improve the silky-smooth spreadabilty and sensorial feel of a product. It is a lightweight silicone, whose appearance as a raw material is a clear, odorless fluid. Cyclopentasiloxane also functions as a solvent to help improve the dispersion of cosmetic ingredients in a solution and improve delivery of key ingredients.
Cyclopentasiloxane is categorized as a volatile silicone, but it’s important to distinguish that the word volatile here doesn’t mean irritating to skin. Instead, it means this kind of silicone evaporates quickly from skin’s surface, which is one of the advantages of formulating with cyclopentasiloxane as it is able to evenly distribute other key ingredients without leaving a heavy or occlusive feel. It also means you don’t have to worry about cyclopentasiloxane “trapping” or “congesting” skin (as is also true for other silicones). The velvety film left behind is permeable, meaning this siloxane doesn’t suffocate skin.
Cyclopentasiloxane also shows up in hair care formulas (particularly conditioners and hair serums) where it lends a softening + smoothing feel and makes hair remarkably shiny.
While cyclopentasiloxane is typically the name that you’ll see on a product’s ingredient list, it also goes by cyclomethicone D5 or just D5 in research literature.
According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel’s assessment (as reported in 2011), cyclopentasiloxane can safely be used in up to 93% in personal care products. It does not pose a health risk to skin as used in cosmetic products.

It is used as a plasticizer, fragrance stabilizer, and is a key component in giving nail polish its unique properties. The most common mode of exposure, though, is through foods that come into contact with PVC (polyvinylchloride) plastic packaging. Phthalates are also found in countless other products, including building materials, insecticides, nutritional supplements, children’s toys, and automobiles (Source: International Journal of Andrology, February 2006, pages 181–185). In short, it is impossible to completely avoid exposure to phthalates.
Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) became controversial when The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals—Results for Mono-butyl phthalate [which is] (metabolized from dibutyl phthalate). The report noted that measurable levels of phthalate were found in the urine of the participants in the study. However, the CDC also stated that “Finding a measurable amount of one or more phthalate metabolites in urine does not mean that the level of one or more phthalates causes an adverse health effect. Whether phthalates at the levels of metabolites reported here are a cause for health concern is not yet known; more research is needed.""
Despite the negative association phthalate exposure has in animals, an analysis of multiple studies and epidemiologic research led to the conclusion that “...the risks are low, even lower than originally thought, and that there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects on humans. Since the scientific evidence strongly suggests that risks to humans are low, phthalate regulations that have been enacted are unlikely to lead to any marked improvement in public health.”

May also be used sunscreen formulation to help the actives distribute evenly on skin.  Considered synthetic, even though it’s derived from natural silicon.  Dimethicone Description Dimethicone is a type of silicone (technically known as a non-volatile/linear silicone). It is one of the most frequently used emollient (softening) ingredients in moisturizers, well known for its gentleness and effectiveness. Dimethicone is recognized as a “skin protectant” by the U.S. FDA, when used in over-the-counter products in concentrations of 1-30%. It forms an air-permeable barrier that works to prevent moisture loss, so skin better retains hydration, while still allowing natural perspiration to evaporate. It imparts a wonderfully silky (but not greasy) feel, which makes it especially popular in oil-free moisturizers. Dimethicone may also be used with other ingredients such as alumina to coat zinc oxide or titanium dioxide in sunscreen formulation to help the actives distribute evenly on skin, providing uniform protection. Dimethicone is considered a synthetic ingredient, even though it’s derived from natural silicon. It has a long track record of being recognized as safe in cosmetic products.

Making it oil-soluble improves penetration into skin and lips, where it works to signal skin from the uppermost layers to repair its supportive elements, leading to fewer visible lines and wrinkles. In essence, hydroxyproline is considered a signal peptide. This ingredient works best when paired with oils or glycols since both increase its affinity for skin. Along with supporting skin’s collagen, it also offsets collagen-degrading enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases. When these enzymes proliferate unchecked, collagen is weakened, leading to signs of sagging and thinning lips. The recommended usage level of dipalmitoyl hydroxyproline is 0.1–2%; clinical studies from suppliers have shown measurable improvement of wrinkle depth when used at 0.5%. Palmitic acid is considered safe for skin, as are proline and hydroxyproline since the latter two are found naturally in skin and its collagen.

DMAE,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/skin-restoring/dmae.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Skin-Restoring'],Average,"DMAE, also known as dimethyl MEA, is a derivative of the B vitamin choline. It has been around for years as an oral supplement that's popularly believed to improve mental alertness, much like Ginkgo biloba and coenzyme Q10. However, the research about DMAE does not show the same positive results as the other two supplements. 
Because DMAE is chemically similar to choline, DMAE is thought to stimulate production of acetylcholine. And because acetylcholine is a brain neurotransmitter, it's easy to see how it could be associated with brain function. However, only a handful of studies have looked at DMAE for that purpose and they have not been conclusive in the least, while some have shown that DMAE may be problematic or not very effective.
It’s a controversial ingredient for skin because research has shown conflicting results. It seems to offer an initial benefit that improves skin firmness, but these results are short-lived and eventually give way to destruction of the substances in skin that help keep it firm. DMAE may also have skin-calming effects.
Interestingly, there is a formulation challenge when including DMAE in skincare products. To maintain the efficacy and stability of DMAE, the product’s pH level must be at least 10. A pH of 10 is highly alkaline, which isn’t good news for skin. 
Moreover, because almost all moisturizers (including serums and eye creams) are formulated with a pH that closely matches that of human skin (generally 5.5–6.5, which is on the acidic side of the scale), in all likelihood the DMAE included in skincare products cannot have any prolonged functionality.

As a result there is research from that part of the world showing it to be a good emollient that can help restore skin. But along with the evidence that emu oil is a good emollient and the parade of companies promoting it for that, there are also companies promoting products containing emu oil for its antiaging properties.

So does emu oil live up to these acclaimed properties? Regrettably, none of these promises are supported by research. A study looked at the ""Cosmetic and moisturizing properties of Emu oil... assessed in a double-blind clinical study. Emu oil in comparison to mineral oil was found overall to be more cosmetically acceptable and had better skin penetration/permeability.""
Like many ingredients, it has soothing, emollient properties, but it isn’t the miracle marketers make it out to be. Emu oil's reputation is driven mostly by claims made by companies selling products that contain it, and not by any real proof that it is an essential requirement for skin.

ensulizole,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sunscreen-actives/ensulizole.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Sunscreen Actives'],Best,"Also known as phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, ensulizole is a water soluble sunscreen ingredient that works in the UVB range, offering no UVA protection. For this reason, ensulizole should always be paired with one or more UVA-screening sunscreen actives in any SPF-rated product labeled “broad spectrum”. There’s some controversy in the research about what some refer to as ensulizole potentially being a “double-edged sword” for skin. Studies on fish scales and bat skin have shown it protects against oxidizing molecules generated by UVB exposure but it can also trigger DNA damage within skin. Although this hasn’t shown to be true on human skin, it may at least partially explain why ensulizole is not commonly found in sunscreens, despite having very few reports of triggering allergic reactions on human skin. Aesthetically, ensulizole feels lighter and less oily than most synthetic sunscreen actives, so is sometimes chosen when the goal is a very lightweight texture, although the mineral actives titanium dioxide and zinc oxide can also feel surprisingly light on skin. Ensulizole concentrations up to 4% are approved for use in sunscreens sold in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea. In most other parts of the world, ensulizole concentrations up to 8% are permitted, with the exception of Japan, whose maximum permitted amount is 3%. Along with protecting skin from UVB damage, ensulizole or its salts are sometimes included in cosmetics whose clear packaging would otherwise allow the formula inside to discolor due to ongoing light exposure. Salt forms of ensulizole include potassium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate, sodium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate and TEA-phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate. This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.

environmental damage,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/environmental-damage.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],Poor,"Occurrence that takes place at an atomic level and is a complex physiological process. Molecules are comprised of atoms. Atoms comprise all matter. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons occur in pairs, and when an element only has a few paired electrons it can easily become unstable.
Oxygen and oxides are primary examples of potential unstable elements in our environment. When oxygen interacts with skin (and because the air we breathe is 20% oxygen, that happens all the time), it almost always loses one of its electrons. This oxygen molecule, which now is minus one electron, is a damaging environmental factor.
Because it is now unstable, the oxygen molecule quickly finds another electron, and it does this by taking an electron from another molecule in the skin, which is usually a healthy substance such as antioxidants in the skin. Antioxidants have lots of electrons to spare. Once those substances are robbed of all their electrons they break down and are destroyed. Oxygen molecules (or other potentially damaging environmental factors) attempting to replenish themselves in this way trigger a cascading event. The reactions that cause environmental damage take place in mere fractions of a second. Antioxidants are substances that prevent oxidative damage from beginning.

The primary causes of environmental damage on skin are pollution, air, cigarette smoke, herbicides, and solvents (such as alcohol). Antioxidants are a way to potentially neutralize these effects via topical application."

Enzymes are used in skincare products to prompt exfoliation. Most enzymes are finicky about how and under what conditions they will act. Sometimes several enzymes are required to carry out a particular  reaction, and their actions are affected by temperature and pH. Some enzymes depend on the presence of other enzymes, called coenzymes, to function, or they depend on a specific body temperature. It would require an exceptionally complicated process to stimulate enzyme activity via topical application to skin.

As a raw material it appears as a clear liquid and is water soluble

Ethoxydiglycol Description
Ethoxydiglycol is considered a safe, well-tolerated synthetic solvent that helps improve the function, penetration, and texture of skin care products. It’s particularly popular in sunless tanning products due to the way it facilitates smooth spreading and minimizes streaking. It can also be found in numerous other personal care products ranging from skin care serums to hair dyes. When used in skin care products, it is known to help key ingredients absorb more effectively.
Ethoxydiglycol also goes by the name diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and is marketed under the trademarked ingredient name Transcutol®. As a raw material it appears as a clear liquid and is water soluble. 
In 2013, the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety concluded that the use of ethoxydiglycol does not pose a risk in leave-on cosmetic formulations at a maximum concentration of 2.6% “taking into account the other uses previously assessed (10% in rinse-off products, 7.0% in oxidative and 5% in non-oxidative hair dye formulation).”

Ethylhexylglycerin Description
Ethylhexylglycerin is a synthetic skin-softening agent. Ethylhexylglycerin can also be used as a preservative and carrier/suspending agent that boosts the efficacy of other preservatives such as phenoxyethanol. It has been shown to have mild humectant properties leading to improved skin hydration without a sticky feel.
Ethylhexylglycerin is also popular in deodorant formulas where it has an inhibiting effect on odor-causing bacteria. Antibacterial action is also where it earns its keep as a preservative, but since it isn’t effective against other type of pathogens, it would always be used with more broad-spectrum preservatives.
As a raw material, ethylhexylglycerin is a pale to colorless liquid. It is formed by a condensation reaction between 2-ethyhexanol (an oil-like ingredient) and glycerin.
In 2013, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed ethylhexylglycerin as safe used in up to 8% concentration in rinse-off products and up to 2% in leave-on formulas. Studies regarding sensitization patch tests of 5% ethylhexylglycerin show that reactions to this ingredient are very rare and their occurrence in a broad population is considered low risk.

Helps soften and smooth skin
Reduces moisture loss from skin’s upper layers
Can help active ingredients more readily penetrate skin
Is used as an alternative to silicone in some skin care products

Ethylhexyl Palmitate Description
Ethylhexyl palmitate is a mixture of a fatty alcohol and palmitic acid that functions in cosmetics products as an emollient (meaning it can soften and smooth skin), texture enhancer, and solvent in amounts from 2–50%, depending on the type of formula and desired aesthetics. It improves the look of skin, particularly dry skin, by helping reduce moisture loss from its upper layers. As a solvent, it helps solubilize other ingredients, helping active ingredients more readily penetrate skin. It helps sunscreen active ingredients such as avobenzone and ethylhexyl triazone disperse and remain evenly suspended in a formula.
Ethylhexyl palmitate has a feel like some silicones and silicone derivatives, making it an alternative to those ingredients in certain formulations. There’s no research indicating this ingredient, which may be synthetic, plant-, or animal-derived, is a problem for skin. Paula’s Choice Skincare uses either the synthetic or plant-derived form of this ingredient depending on the product.

ethylparaben,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/ethylparaben.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],Good,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

For example, “FD&C Blue No. 1–Aluminum Lake” means that the color FD&C Blue No. 1 has been combined with aluminum. Lake colors are used for candies and for dyes used to color Easter eggs, among countless cosmetics applications.
The current group of FD&C colors has been extensively studied, with many classified as “permanently approved” for use in drugs and foods. Some FD&C colors, such as Blue 1 and Blue 2, are derivatives of coal tar and can cause allergic reactions, although the amounts used in items such as lipsticks typically are lower than the amounts used for other types of coloring agents. No coal tar colors are permitted in products for use around the eyes, and every batch of coal tar color must be deemed safe before it can be used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics.
Any coloring agent used in eye makeup must be specifically approved for that purpose by the FDA.
The color of cosmetics products is often an emotional pull for many consumers. A soft pink lotion can denote a moisturizer meant to calm or soothe skin, while a bright yellow balm may be deemed energizing. Whether natural or synthetic, coloring agents in skincare products serve no purpose other than to create a perception or an emotional response to the product. Coloring agents used in makeup are a different story, as they’re used to create an endless kaleidoscope of shades.

Antioxidant that helps defend skin from the signs of sun damage and environmental assault
Improves stability and efficacy of other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E
Research indicates ferulic acid can help inhibit discolorations

As a raw material, ferulic acid is supplied as a crystalline powder

Ferulic Acid Description
Ferulic acid is a phenolic antioxidant (a type that intercepts damaging hydrogen radicals) that is naturally found in bran and bamboo shoots, among other plants. Research has shown that it provides its own benefits to skin while also enhancing the stability of other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, when paired with them.
Of note, ferulic acid plays a significant photoprotective role, which is one of the reasons it’s a welcome addition in sunscreen formulations.
Research also indicates that it has the ability to inhibit certain triggers of skin discolorations, making ferulic acid a nice complement to products that are intended for evening skin tone. In general, it also helps defend skin against environmental assault.
Ferulic acid can be used in the types of high concentration chemical peels available in a dermatologist/esthetician setting, where it is usually combined with other acids, such as lactic, to address signs of photoaging. Ferulic acid’s soothing properties are believed to help reduce potential skin-irritating side effects of such peels.
As a raw material, ferulic acid comes as a crystalline powder that is insoluble in water at room temperature but reaches solubility in higher water temps. It is also soluble in other types of solvents.
Ferulic acid is shown to be most effective at boosting the results from other antioxidants when used in concentrations of 0.5% or greater. It is typically not used above 1%, as doing so can impart an undesirable color to a skin care formula.

It’s a rich source of a class of antioxidants known as phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, various epicatechins, and anthocyanins which contribute to the rich, often dark color of fig skin and the fruit inside. Along with being an antioxidant, fig has been shown to enhance skin’s hydration by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. It can also visibly improve skin color by addressing an enzyme in skin (tyrosinase) whose overproduction can lead to dark spots. Those benefits are intriguing, but there’s more: fig extract has also been to help reduce uncomfortably dry, tight skin, including compromised, redness-prone skin. One caution: Fig contains a group of naturally-occurring compounds known as psoralens. These can make skin more sensitive to sun exposure, but you can get around this by using a broad spectrum sunscreen every day. The leaves, root and sap from the fig plant contain the highest concentration of psoralens, which is why the fruit portion, which contains appreciably low levels, is typically used in skin care.

As with most other types of mushrooms, Ganoderma lucidum is also a very good antioxidant. The extract form of this mushroom eliminates the water component (the whole mushroom that you’d buy in the grocery store contains over 90% water), so only a small amount is needed to get its benefits.

Mangosteen peel both interrupts and helps repair the visible damage from free radicals on skin; however, the peel of this plant is considered inedible, so bodily health benefits from this plant are due to consumption of the fruit portion. On skin, all parts of the mangosteen plant exert pronounced calming benefits which helps visibly improve multiple skin concerns.

gluten ingredients,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/gluten-ingredients.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],Good,"Gluten is a protein that occurs naturally in many types of grains, including wheat, rye, and barley. As a general group, gluten ingredients include several grains or grain-derived ingredients that are potentially problematic for those diagnosed with a health condition that interferes with the normal digestion of glutens. In this instance, eating gluten-containing foods is ill-advised.
The question is whether those with such a health condition or dietary sensitivity should avoid gluten ingredients in cosmetics, and the answer is no. That’s because gluten ingredients cannot get past the skin’s uppermost layers and enter the body (specifically, the digestive system) where they can be troublesome for those with a gluten intolerance. Gluten is simply too big to get into the body via topical application. 
The exception is applying gluten-containing products to lips, as in these instances some amount of ingestion occurs. Therefore, you’d want to avoid lip balm, gloss, or lipstick/lip color products that contain gluten ingredients.
Of course, if you have an allergy to gluten ingredients you’d want to check with your health care provider to determine if the allergy is limited to oral consumption or also includes topical application (assuming you haven’t already determined that topical application of gluten ingredients is a problem for you).
If you have a known sensitivity to gluten, avoid products that contain wheat and its derivatives, malt, barley, rye, wheat germ, and oat ingredients.

Is a skin-restoring ingredient, meaning it is found naturally in skin
Functions as a humectant, helping skin retain moisture
A fundamental cornerstone of most moisturizers
Typically used in concentrations of 5% or less
Amounts of 10% or greater aid in skin healing

Glycerin Description
Glycerin, also called glycerol or glycerine, is a humectant that’s present in all natural lipids (fats), whether animal or vegetable. It can be derived from natural substances by hydrolysis of fats and by fermentation of sugars; it also can be synthetically manufactured, which is usually the case with modern-day skin care products, as doing so results in highly purified glycerin.
Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and skin-restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration. It’s one of the many substances in skin that helps maintain a healthy look and feel, defending against dryness and working to maintain skin’s moisture level. Essentially, glycerin is a master at hydration, and works best when combined with other replenishing and emollient ingredients.
Some people wonder whether using products with glycerin takes too much water from skin when there isn’t enough humidity in the air. This can occur with pure glycerin (that is, at a 100% concentration—an amount that’s never used in skin care products). Any humectant (including glycerin) used in pure form can increase water loss by attracting water from the lower layers of skin into the surface layers when the climate is too arid (low humidity). For this reason, glycerin and humectants are typically used in concentrations of 5% or less and always combined with other ingredients to soften skin. In fact, glycerin combined with other emollients and/or oils is a fundamental cornerstone of most moisturizers. However, amounts of 10% or greater can be used in clinical circumstances for skin healing.

Made by binding ascorbic acid with hydrating glycerin
Helps visibly fade discoloration by inhibiting transfer of excess melanin
Excellent skin penetration and easier to formulate with than ascorbic acid
Not considered as potent an antioxidant as pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 
Most effective in a pH between 3–5 and more stable than ascorbic acid

Glyceryl Ascorbate Description
Glyceryl ascorbate is a water-soluble form of vitamin C made by binding ascorbic acid with the humectant glycerin. This compound is considered more stable and offers formulary flexibility because it isn’t beholden to the same narrow pH range for efficacy compared to pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
This form shares many of the same benefits as regular vitamin C, including being an antioxidant, improving skin tone, helping to fade hyperpigmentation and post-breakout marks, and supporting skin’s firmness.
A derivative of glyceryl ascorbate known as 3-O-Laurylglyceryl ascorbate (VC-3LG) has been shown to improve ceramide synthesis in skin which in turn helps strengthen skin’s surface against moisture loss. VC-3LG is also a formidable antioxidant and can help improve skin’s natural antioxidant defenses.
Interestingly, although glyceryl ascorbate and its derivatives are very good antioxidants, they’re considered less potent than ascorbic acid, which is less stable in the presence of light and air. This is likely due to the molecular changes necessary to create vitamin C derivatives. There’s a trade-off between greater stability and reduced antioxidant potential.
Concentration range of glyceryl ascorbate in skin care is between 1–10%; however, there are no studies showing which percentages are needed for results on discolorations, wrinkles, or skin tone improvement. Instead, some studies imply that the concentrations for such benefits are comparable to pure vitamin C.

As with all plant oils, it has skin-smoothing emollient properties, plus it’s a good source of antioxidants and replenishing fatty acids. Studies have shown that compounds in soy, most likely isoflavones, help fade stubborn discolorations from sun exposure and other sources. They help to reduce excess transfer of melanin to skin’s surface, thereby visibly reducing hyperpigmentation. Soybean oil’s antioxidant content includes polyphenols known as isoflavones, particularly daidzein and genistein. These have been shown to help protect skin from UV light-triggered damage. The antioxidants in soy can also help maintain hydration by preventing water loss. In oil form, soy can help maintain skin’s smooth, supple surface thanks to its blend of fatty acids such as palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic. These fatty acids in the oil plus the naturally-present antioxidants are responsible for the soothing effect soy has in the presence of external aggressors.

Another form of gold used in skincare products is “colloidal gold,” which means that the gold particles have been nanosized (usually to 1–15 nanometers) so that it remains dispersed evenly throughout a solution. Although gold is a heavy metal, and heavy metals are subject to regulations, colloidal gold preparations are not regulated, so the risks are unknown. Initial research shows that it is fairly safe.
Colloidal gold also is used in the world of medicine, where there is a minor amount of research that it might have benefit because of assumed skin-soothing properties. Most of that research, however, is either very old or was performed on only a very small group of people, not enough to prove efficacy.
Even if gold were a good skin-soothing agent, its effects have never been compared with the effects of the numerous potent and stable skin-soothing ingredients that are commonly used in skincare products and that have a great deal of research proving their benefit and safety. What is for certain: There is no published research proving that gold, normal or colloidal in size, has any anti-aging benefits.

This oil also contains other beneficial fatty acids skin can use, including oleic, palmitic, stearic, and a small amount of omega-3 linolenic acid. Sunflower oil is particularly beneficial for dry, dehydrated, or environmentally compromised skin because its linoleic acid content helps skin synthesize its own lipids (fats), including ceramides, visibly repairing its barrier and leading to smoother, healthier-looking skin. Sunflower seed oil also has a natural calming effect on skin, so can be helpful for reducing signs of skin stress or irritation. In fact, research on infants with atopic dermatitis has shown that topical sunflower oil is a viable ingredient to alternate with topical steroids normally prescribed to control symptoms of this skin disorder.

Specifically, hemp seed oil contains the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Hemp seed oil also contains beneficial phospholipids, plant sterols, amino acids (it’s especially high in the amino acid arginine) and is a rich source of antioxidant vitamin E. Another benefit of hemp seed oil is that it seems to enhance the benefits of cannabidiol, also known as CBD. This is likely due to the interaction between trace amounts of cannabinoids in hemp seed oil and pure cannabidiol.

Technically, no. As it comes from bees, it is considered an animal (insect) byproduct. Although the starting point for honey is nectar from flowering plants, the bee itself makes the honey via digestive enzymes in its stomach and a regurgitation process that’s shared with other bees, followed by dehydration and storage in wax structures known as honeycombs. The bees use honey as a food source in the wild; however, when bees are carefully and ethically farmed, the hive’s workers produce much more honey than the colony needs to thrive. The excess is used as sweetener by people and in various skin care products.

It can work in cleansing formulas as a surfactant while adding emollient and texture-enhancing properties to products such as moisturizers, makeup, and sunscreens. The natural form derived from castor oil is used most, but hydroxystearic acid can also be made synthetically. It is chemically similar to stearic acid, another fatty acid used in thousands of skin care, makeup, and hair care products since it is non-irritating and works well in many types of formulas. Emerging research from a supplier of an oleic acid-derived form of hydroxystearic acid shows it may play a role in reducing pore size and fading discolorations; however, independent research is needed to verify such claims. Research from Unilever shows it works to help offset hyperpigmentation triggered by exposure to airborne pollutants, possibly due to its antioxidant ability which prevented the oxidation of lipids (fats) in skin that would normally occur when exposed to such pollutants. Hydroxystearic acid is considered safe as used in cosmetics at concentrations of 10% or less. The typical usage level for this ingredient is 1–5%.

Other published studies compared the red grape antioxidant compound reseveratrol and L-ergothioneine to idebenone and found both superior to idebenone 

To date, there are still no published, peer-reviewed studies that support idebenone’s alleged superiority. This does not mean idebenone is not a valid antioxidant for skin. Given what we know about how ubiquinone performs in the body, it is definitely not a throwaway ingredient. What is fairly certain, however, is that it is neither the best nor most potent antioxidant around.

All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

Lanolin has long been burdened with a reputation for being a sensitizing agent, which has always been a disappointment to formulators because lanolin is such an effective moisturizing ingredient. 
A study in the British Journal of Dermatology concluded “that lanolin sensitization has remained at a relatively low and constant rate even in a high-risk population.” Based on a review of 24,449 patients who were tested with varying forms of lanolin, it turned out that “The mean annual rate of sensitivity was 1.7%”—and it was lower than that for a 50% concentration of lanolin. The amounts of lanolin used in products like facial and body moisturizers are much less than this, so the risk, if any, is negligible. 
Lanolin is a very good ingredient for someone with dry skin, though it can be a problem for someone with oily or breakout-prone skin. Also, as an animal-derived ingredient, lanolin is sometimes viewed as less favorable in comparison to synthetic or plant-derived alternatives.

Replenishing ingredient that improves skin’s moisture retention
Well known for its versatility as an emulsifying agent in cosmetic formulas
Can also be used to encapsulate key ingredients to achieve improved dermal delivery
Typically derived from soy, sunflower and rapeseed in cosmetic formulas
Long track record of safety in skin care products

Lecithin Description
Lecithin in skin care formulations serves a variety of roles including functioning as an emollient (think softening), water-binding agent (to boost hydration), and emulsifying agent (to help water + oil ingredients mesh better in a formula). Lecithin is naturally present in many living organisms, but in cosmetic formulas it’s almost always derived from plants such as soy, sunflower or rapeseed.
Lecithin’s beneficial components include phospholipids (which convey skin-restoring benefits), fatty acids and triglycerides that can help replenish skin. Lecithin can also be used to encapsulate a wide range of active ingredients allowing for a better dermal delivery system.
Lecithin’s appearance as a raw material varies based on the origin and extraction process, but in cosmetic use it typically presents as a viscous liquid or as powder. In a safety assessment conducted in 2020, the highest concentration of lecithin that was reported was 50% in a leave-on foot product, which was deemed safe. Facial skin care products typically safely contain much lower concentrations than that, usually between 0.5–2%.

It functions as an emollient and softening agent in skin care and hair care products. This plant oil is exceedingly stable because it is primarily composed of long chain fatty acids, the type most resistant to rancidity when exposed to oxygen. Among plant oils, meadowfoam has the highest concentration (95%) of these highly stable fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to products that would otherwise be prone to spoiling quickly. Meadowfoam seed oil contains two compounds known as glucosinolate derivatives, 3-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate (MBITC) and 3-methoxyphenyl acetonitrile. Research has shown these compounds can inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure (but just to be clear, these ingredients do not replace the need for broad spectrum sunscreen). The glucosinolate derivatives are not direct antioxidants (indeed, meadowfoam seed oil isn’t a good source of antioxidants), but they can positively influence skin’s own antioxidant defenses, which is a nice benefit. Meadowfoam seed oil can also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into soil and across animal skin; however, to date the same benefit hasn’t been shown to occur on human skin. On the upside, the long-chain fatty acids in this plant oil have chemical similarity to some of the fatty acids found in skin’s own oil, so in theory it’s certainly possible meadowfoam oil would help deliver other oil-based (lipophilic) ingredients to skin.

Water-soluble yet oil-loving stabilized form of vitamin C
Delivers many of the same benefits as vitamin C
Promotes hydration deeper in skin, but not as potent an antioxidant as pure vitamin C
Isn’t beholden to a low pH for efficacy and is generally well tolerated
Soothing properties may play a role in reducing blemishes

Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate Description
Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP, for short) is a water-soluble form of vitamin C made by combining ascorbic acid (pure vitamin C) with a magnesium salt to improve its stability in water-based formulas. It is considered stable in the presence of light and air but is not impervious to diminished efficacy when exposure to both elements is persistent.
Unlike other water-soluble forms of vitamin C, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate is also lipophilic, or oil-loving, which improves penetration into skin (although how well this form converts to ascorbic acid within skin is up for debate). Because of its oil-loving nature and its ability to promote hydration deeper in skin when compared to ascorbic acid (which instead showed greater antioxidant ability), MAP is considered one of the most hydrating forms of vitamin C.
Like most forms of vitamin C, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has been shown to improve the look of an uneven skin tone when used in concentrations between 2–5%. Concentrations between 5–10% are known to have more pronounced benefits for discolorations, including post-breakout marks, as well as improving skin’s firm look and feel. Amounts below 2% all the way down to 0.1% still deliver antioxidant benefits. 
Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate does not require the same low pH ascorbic acid does in order to be effective. It works best at pH levels between 5–6. Going above pH 6 can cause this ingredient to discolor.
This form of vitamin C may play a special role in reducing the likelihood of blemishes since its soothing action helps quell an of oil-based saccharide that can irritate skin. However, research on this matter was not comparative, meaning we don’t know how a range of other forms of vitamin C would’ve fared.
It is considered safe as used in cosmetics.

Mandelic Acid Description
Mandelic acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). There’s some research showing mandelic acid is an effective exfoliant, although it’s not as effective as glycolic acid due to its larger size (it’s twice as big as glycolic acid) and slower penetration into skin; however, these traits can also make mandelic acid more tolerable for those with sensitive skin. Unlike glycolic acid, mandelic acid is light-sensitive and must be packaged in an opaque container to remain effective. It may be synthetic or derived from almonds. Like other AHAs, mandelic acid is most effective in leave-on products that are within a 3-4 pH range.
A couple studies have shown that mandelic acid and salicylic acid worked well together in a higher-strength peel for use on darker skin tones struggling with discolorations, including post-acne marks. However, what we don’t know is how well mandelic acid would’ve worked on its own—it’s possible the results were more from salicylic acid than the combination of the two acids. Other research has shown mandelic acid can increase sebum (oil) production, which isn’t great for oily skin but would be a benefit for dry skin.

methylparaben,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/methylparaben.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],Good,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

Interestingly, some research has shown that mulberry twigs work in a different manner to improve uneven skin color, as the twig contains a different mix of beneficial ingredients than the root. The same is true for the leaves of this plant, which are a rich source of the skin tone-improving antioxidant oxyresveratrol (although this compound is also present in the root, it’s more concentrated in the leaf). Overall, topical application of this plant extract helps calm stressed skin, which in turn reduces signs of environmental damage and fosters a brighter, more radiant skin tone.

Boosts skin’s barrier strength and hydration. Helps mitigate negative effects of environmental stressors.  Also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinamide. Stable in the presence of light (which is unique for an antioxidant).  Niacinamide Description Niacinamide (also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinamide) is a unique skin-restoring ingredient that offers a multitude of benefits for skin. It is best known for its ability to help visibly reduce enlarged pores and improve uneven/dull skin tone. It also strengthens a weakened skin barrier.  An advantage of niacinamide’s antioxidant power is that it can help visibly repair damage from UV light while offsetting other sources of environmental attack (including the negative impact of airborne pollutants). Another helpful benefit is that niacinamide helps fortify skin’s surface against moisture loss and dehydration by boosting its natural production of skin-strengthening ceramides. Studies have also shown niacinamide has a positive effect on reducing wrinkle depth.  Unlike many superstar anti-aging ingredients, niacinamide is stable in the presence of heat and light. It is water soluble and presents as colorless needles or white crystalline powder in its raw material state.  Niacinamide offers benefits for skin starting in concentrations as low 0.2%, and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded it is safe in concentrations all the way up to 20%.  Myths about niacinamide’s incompatibility with other “bio-active” ingredients have been dispelled, and in fact, research overwhelmingly shows complementary effects of combining niacinamide with other key anti-aging ingredients. In particular, we provide a deeper dive into the research and benefits of using niacinamide + retinol and using niacinamide + vitamin C together.  For an advanced understanding of niacinamide, see our article How Niacinamide Helps Skin.

For example, such “studies” use extremely high concentrations of octinoxate (much higher than would ever be used in sunscreens) or even fed to lab animals. There simply isn’t any research backing the claim that octinoxate has any link to health risks when used in sunscreen formulas. In fact, the European Union’s permitted usage level for octinoxate in sunscreens is higher than the maximum amount permitted in the United States (7.5% in the United States, 10% in the EU).This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.References for this information:Pharmazie, 2013, issue 1, pages 34-40Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, 2005, issue 4, pages170-174"

It’s the primary fatty acid in olive oil, and believed to play a role in this oil’s cholesterol-lowering benefits when consumed orally. Interestingly, research has shown that topical application of oleic acid on its own or as olive oil can disrupt skin’s barrier; however, this effect was not observed when oleic acid was blended with other fatty acids and skin-beneficial ingredients. On the upside, this kind of barrier disruption can enhance penetration of other ingredients naturally present in plant oils or in the product, so it’s not necessarily all bad (and, as we mentioned, not bad at all unless you’re applying pure oleic acid or straight olive oil to skin). In another interesting twist, combining oleic acid with other lipids (fats) boosts its skin-calming ability, thus making oleic acid useful for reducing signs of dryness and sensitivity. In cosmetics, oleic acid is used as a cleansing agent and texture enhancer. It’s among the more stable fatty acids, and has a unique ability to preserve the effectiveness of more delicate ingredients such as antioxidants by helping to protect them from light and air degradation.

Its safety in sunscreens is well established.As a group, the benzophenones are used not only for sun protection but also as photostabilizers in cosmetics products. That means they keep products from turning color or from degrading in the presence of sunlight. They also have other uses, including flavor enhancers in food.Oxybenzone is sometimes called out as a sunscreen active that is damaging to undersea coral reefs, the theory being that the sunscreen gets into the water from human activity in the oceans. However, despite research showing oxybenzone negatively impacts coral components in vitro (meaning in a lab setting), there doesn’t seem to be conclusive causation in a marine environment, especially given the numerous other factors, including climate change, believed to be responsible for the loss of coral reefs.The Personal Care Products Council looked at the research and concluded the following: “Degradation of the world’s coral reefs is a serious concern. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program, coral reefs are threatened by an increasing array of impacts – primarily from global climate change, unsustainable fishing and other factors.

May also help reduce sensitivity-induced redness in skin. Often referred to as pro-vitamin B5. Converts into pantothenic acid when applied topically. White, crystalline powder in its raw material state.  Panthenol Description Panthenol (sometimes referred to as pro-vitamin B5) is a popular humectant in personal care products due to its ability to attract and hold moisture. When topically applied, it converts to pantothenic acid, which is a naturally occurring substance within the body. Studies show that 1% panthenol quickly increase skin’s hydration, while decreasing transepidermal water loss (the amount of water that evaporates through skin). The overall result is an improvement in the way skin feels and looks, including a more supple appearance. Research also shows promise for panthenol’s ability to reduce sensitivity-induced redness in skin. Topically applied panthenol in amounts between 1–5% has been reported to aid in healing and barrier repair. It’s important to clarify that even though panthenol is the alcohol derivative of pantothenic acid, but it is a completely gentle and non-drying form of alcohol, unlike SD or denatured alcohol, which are known to be damaging to skin. Panthenol is water soluble and “plays well” with many different types of ingredients, making it easy to formulate with for moisturizers, serums, toners, etc. It is also widely used in hair care products and can be found in makeup products, such as powders, mascara, and lipstick. As a raw material, two forms of panthenol can be incorporated in personal care product formulas: D-panthenol is a viscous oil and DL-panthenol comes in the form of a white, crystalline powder. According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review assessment from 2018, the highest reported concentration of panthenol in a personal care product was 5.3%, which was deemed safe in its use.

parabens,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/parabens.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],Good,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plant’s own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or that they are found naturally in plants, so either source could have been the origin, not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects, but those were done in vitro (meaning in a petri dish) or, again, they were animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

PEG is often mixed with an array of hydrating emollients, beneficial fatty acids, and cleansing agents. In these various combinations, a PEG can be used in gentle cleansers, elegant moisturizers, sunscreens, and unique treatment products. The safety of PEG in its various forms has recently been questioned. The primary concern is that they can contain problematic impurities such as ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane. Both of these are by-products from the manufacturing process, not something natural to any form of PEG. Although this was once a concern, reputable cosmetic ingredient suppliers have long since eliminated these impurities from the finished ingredient, which makes PEGs safe for skin. What is most notable about the various forms of PEG studied to date is they have been shown to be non-irritating for skin or eyes, even when used in concentrations greater than what most skin care products contain. PEGs also widely considered non-toxic because they do not penetrate intact skin. However, as is true for even the gentlest ingredients, when skin is inflamed or compromised, the risk of irritation is increased. If you’ve seen conflicting information about PEG ingredients, it’s important to know that the conclusions were not applicable to how PEGs are used in skin care products. These studies involved feeding a large amount of PEG to animals or applying very high doses (literally hundreds of magnitudes greater than what is used in topical products) to mouse skin.

Its oil-soluble nature means it pairs best with other oils and fats in a formula. Although it is available and can be used on its own, this antioxidant is commonly used in a blend with other ingredients such as emollient squalane and film-forming polymers as more of a “total package” of stability, texture enhancing, creating stick formulas (as in lipstick and sunscreen sticks), and also serving as an alternative to silicone ingredients.

Pentylene Glycol Description
Pentylene glycol is an ingredient which is found naturally in some plants (such as sugar beets and corn cobs) but is most frequently lab-derived when used in cosmetics. It is a humectant, meaning it binds well to water, making it a good hydrating agent and solvent to aid penetration of other ingredients. It also helps improve the texture of skin care formulas and has mild preservative properties when used in amounts between 1-5%.
There have been some reports that pentylene glycol (along with other glycols) is a skin sensitizer; however, as with many ingredients, the amount and how it’s used are key. In cosmetics formulations the concentration of pentylene glycol ranges from 0.001% to 5%, an amount which the Cosmetics Ingredient Review panel has deemed safe to use in leave-on products.

Skin is composed primarily of a protein known as keratin, so peptides have a role to play as part of a complete skincare routine—though as with any anti-aging ingredient, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic!Ongoing research has shown that all peptides have some amount of skin-restorative ability, assuming the formulation supports the type of peptide used and is packaged to protect it from degrading from light and air exposure during use (no jars!).Ironically, peptides can become unstable in water-based formulas. Further, because peptides are vulnerable to attack by enzymes, the abundant enzymes present in skin can break the peptides down to the point where they have no effect. Knowledge of these inherent weaknesses has led many ingredient manufacturing companies to produce synthetic peptides engineered to be more stable on and within skin. Such peptides can survive intact on skin and better reach their target areas—so you’ll see anti-aging benefits!Some peptides have demonstrated a remarkable skin-soothing effect, while others can improve the appearance of wrinkles, loss of firmness, and even help to soften the look of expression lines.Don’t get seduced by the notion that there’s a best peptide or peptide blend because there isn’t.

Petrolatum Description
Petrolatum is a rich emollient and FDA-approved skin protectant. It is one of the best ingredients for dry to very dry skin, including around the eyes. Although derived from crude oil (thus making petrolatum a natural ingredient), it is highly purified prior to being used in cosmetics, so there’s no risk of exposure to unwanted chemicals.
For some unknown and unsubstantiated reason (and despite solid research to the contrary), petrolatum has attained a negative image regarding skin. Topical application of petrolatum can help replenish, soothe, and beautifully moisturize skin’s outer layer. It’s widely considered safe and highly effective. Extensive clinical data has shown petrolatum to be a gentle ingredient.
Small amounts of petrolatum are commonly found in moisturizers, but you can also find products with 100% concentrations, such as Vaseline®.

Protects formulas from broad-spectrum pathogenic activity. Backed by decades of research and safety assessments. Versatile in that it is compatible in a large range of formulas/pH ranges. Considered gentle on skin (incidence of a sensitized reaction to phenoxyethanol is rare).  Phenoxyethanol Description Phenoxyethanol is a widely used synthetic preservative with global approval for use in rinse-off or leave-on cosmetic products in concentrations up to 1%. It’s often used in even lower amounts, especially when combined with other preservatives. Phenoxyethanol is incredibly versatile in that it works in a large range of formulas and pH ranges and offers broad-spectrum activity against many pathogens. It is both water and oil soluble and is compatible with many other preservatives used in cosmetics. While phenoxyethanol has gotten a bad rap in recent years, the controversial research behind this movement is not about the cosmetics-grade phenoxyethanol, and that’s important to keep in mind. Think of it this way: even plant extracts have to be purified when they are removed from the ground and put into skin care products. No one wants worms and dirt in their products. Phenoxyethanol is similar in that it’s purified before it’s used in cosmetic formulations, and it in that form it’s safe, backed by decades of safety assessments. Concentration also matters. A 100% concentration of phenoxyethanol comes with some scary warnings. For example, the Safety Data Sheet on this preservative describes it as harmful if it contacts skin, is inhaled, or gets into the eyes—but this doesn’t apply to the 1% concentration used in cosmetics. Animal studies where mice were fed large doses of this preservative have also sparked concern. However this is not indicative of how phenoxyethanol is used on skin. Research shows that compared to many other preservatives, the incidence of a sensitized or allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol applied as used in cosmetics is rare. But the truth is all preservatives, even the natural ones, carry some risk of sensitizing skin because preservatives of any kind are meant to kill fungus, bacteria, and mold and that may negatively impact skin. The risk to your skin from such pathogens is far greater than the risk any preservative could present. Ironically, for natural preservatives to be effective, they must be used in much higher amounts than synthetic preservatives, typically up to 10%. Higher amounts may irritate or sensitize skin, so natural preservatives aren’t even close to a slam-dunk replacement for synthetics. An interesting factoid: Although the phenoxyethanol used in skin care products is synthetic, this chemical occurs naturally in green tea.

The most compelling research looked at the results of a cream with phenylethyl resorcinol plus three other skin-brightening agents. The product was applied over a period of 3 months by 20 women, all of whom also used sunscreen. At the end of the study, it was determined that the women’s uneveness decreased by 43%.
The problem is we don’t know how much of this improvement is due to phenylethyl resorcinol, as it wasn’t used alone, which is the case with most products using this ingredient as a means to improve the appearance of an uneven skin tone. Until more research comes to light, this isn’t an ingredient to bank on for great results if an uneven skin tone is your concern; however, it’s fine to use in products that also contain other skin-brightening ingredients with established track records of success.

Some are considered safe, and others are considered to pose a potential risk. Those that are considered to be potential risks are not approved for use in consumer packaging were banned in the US as well as the EU (these are phthalates DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP). Just to be clear, these have never been used in personal care products to begin with, rather they are used for industrial products.

However, those phthalates that have proven to be safe are not banned in the US or EU (DEP, for example, AKA diethyl phthalate is used in the EU in packaging for personal care products and other consumer items, and was given broad approval of safety in 2007.
The EU (Scientific Committee on Consumer Products) did a thorough and detailed degree of research of prior and new research and found that there was no plausible risk from what trace amounts exist in packaging for personal care products.
An earlier study in 2001 in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology already arrived at this conclusion so far as the risk of DEP in personal care products.
What is often cited as a risk by crusaders is either phthalates that are not present in personal care, food or medical device packaging materials (therefore not applicable) or studies that utilize massive doses of a type of types of phthalates (beyond what would be possible in humans).
Bisphenol A (BPA) is sometimes confused with phthalates, but is a completely unrelated substance. Either way, BPA also has been demonstrated, exhaustively, to be safe for use in packaging for food or cosmetics. In 2007, the EU found them safe. In 2009, a study published in Critical Reviews in Toxicology found that BPA poses no risk from to humans. In 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the FDA found (repeatedly) that BPA is safe as used in packaging for food and cosmetics.

They’re supposed to be as effective as AHAs, but less sensitizing. Gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between them and AHAs is that gluconolactone and lactobionic acid have larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for sensitizing side-effects. Supposedly, this reduced absorption into the skin does not hamper their effectiveness. Does that mean gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are better for your skin than AHAs in the form of glycolic acid or lactic acid? According to an Internet-published class lecture by Dr. Mark G. Rubin, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, research on gluconolactone demonstrated only a “6% decrease in dermal penetration” in comparison to glycolic acid, which “isn’t a dramatic improvement.” Gluconolactone may be slightly less sensitizing for some skin types, but this isn’t the magic bullet for exfoliation some cosmetics companies have been extolling. Polyhydroxy acids can also function as antioxidants and may promote some amount of improvement in skin’s surface strength.References for this information:Clinics in Dermatology, September-October 2009, pages 495-501Cutis, February 2004, Supplement, pages 3-13"

Polysorbate 20 Description
In skin care, polysorbate 20 belongs to a group of cleansing agents most often derived from lauric acid, which is a medium-chain triglyceride (a type of fatty acid) found in coconuts.
Polysorbates for skin function as emulsifiers and have mild surfactant properties; some polysorbates are derived from the food ingredient sorbitol, which occurs naturally in many fruits, while others have a fatty acid component.
In addition to its use in both leave-on and rinse-off skin care products, polysorbate 20 is also used as a food additive to create a “spreading” feel (such as in cooling mint drops). Because of its stability, it is also used in drug delivery systems for oral medications to help keep them stable in the presence of digestive enzymes.
Though there have been some concerns raised about the safety of polysorbate 20, but the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled it safe as used in cosmetics. The highest concentration of polysorbate 20 as used in cosmetics is in spray deodorants, where it is used in a concentration of 4%.

Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate Description
Potassium azeloyl diglycinate offers many of the same benefits as pure azelaic acid (including the ability to improve uneven tone), with the advantage that is easier to incorporate into various types of cosmetic formulas due to its increased stability and compatibility. Of significance, potassium azeloyl diglycinate plays a role in reducing the appearance of redness and discomfort associated with sensitive skin.
Potassium azeloyl diglycinate is a water-soluble ingredient obtained from the condensation of azelaic acid mixed with glycine. The glycine gives it a hydrating/moisturizing effect that helps improve conditions for compromised skin.
Simultaneously, potassium azeloyl diglycinate has the ability to normalize and in turn help minimize excess oil in skin. This can help with skin issues associated the overproduction of sebum (think clogged pores, breakouts, etc.).
More research is necessary to determine the concentration range needed to produce optimal results, but from the studies currently available as well as information from ingredient suppliers, we can conclude that a 0.5% concentration is beneficial for soothing skin, while amounts between 2–3% can help fade skin discolorations and influence sebum.

It also plays a role in keeping formulas from melting in high heat or from freezing in low temps.

They further point out that the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on propylene glycol warns users to avoid skin contact. As ominous as this sounds, it’s far from the reality of how propylene glycol is used in cosmetics formulations. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board and other groups have analyzed the toxicology data and exposure studies concerning topical application of propylene glycol as commonly used in cosmetics.

All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

In terms of skincare, research has shown that a lipid-based delivery system is optimal for quercetin to exert antioxidant benefits. Even more exciting, this type of formula provides an initial burst of quercetin followed by sustained release over a 24-hour period. When quercetin is mixed with silicone and lipids, the intake is greater, as confirmed by testing on human skin.

Retinol is a powerhouse ingredient that has value for skin on several fronts: It’s a skin-restoring, wrinkle-smoothing, firming ingredient and an antioxidant, allowing it to improve a variety of skin concerns, most related to visible signs of aging. Packaging is a key issue, so any container that lets in air (like jar packaging) or sunlight (clear containers) just won’t cut it. Lots of retinol products come in unacceptable packaging; these should be avoided because the retinol will most likely be (or quickly become) ineffective. Look for opaque, airless, or air-restrictive packaging. Many consumers are concerned about the percentage of retinol in anti-aging products such as serums or moisturizers. Although the percentage can make a difference (especially if it’s too low), it’s not helpful in understanding how a retinol product will benefit your skin. Far more important is the delivery system, packaging, and the other ingredients present with the retinol.  Using a product with a range of anti-aging ingredients plus retinol is far more valuable for skin than using a product with only a supposedly high percentage of retinol. Skin needs far more than any one ingredient can provide, however great that one ingredient may be. See our article on this topic for detailed information. There are several myths about using retinol with other anti-aging ingredients or products, such as those with vitamin C or exfoliants like glycolic acid. See our article on this topic to learn what the research has shown to be true.

You may be surprised to learn that retinyl palmitate is found naturally in our skin, where it works as an antioxidant, particularly in regard to helping protect skin from UV light exposure—though it does not replace the need for sunscreen. Reports that retinyl palmitate is not a safe ingredient are false. They’re based on a study from nearly 20 years ago that has never been reproduced or tested under real-life conditions such as how people use sunscreens that contain this ingredient. In addition, to date, there is no scientific evidence that retinyl palmitate is a carcinogen in humans. The safety of retinyl palmitate is supported by several accredited organizations and their opinions are widely available online.

Retinyl retinoate has been shown, in limited but promising research (most coming from the same team of Korea-based researchers), to be less sensitizing than retinoic acid (prescription-strength) and cosmetic retinol. Retinyl retinoate may be less sensitizing than pure retinol because of its slower conversion in skin to retinoic acid. However, when it comes to sensitivity from retinol, there’s much that can be done using time-release delivery systems and ingredient additions to maximize its benefits to skin while minimizing, if not eliminating, its risk of sensitivity.
Although there’s reason to consider retinyl retinoate if your skin seems intolerant of cosmetic retinol, it shouldn’t be construed as better or safer for skin than such alternatives.

This group of tannins does not have the astringent quality of the type of tannins that naturally occur in the witch hazel plant.Applied to skin, red raspberry can inhibit enzymes in skin that lead to signs of discolorations and loss of firmness. Of course, these benefits also rely on daily use of broad spectrum sunscreen to protect skin from exposure to UV light.Speaking of UV light, research has also shown topical application of red raspberry extract helps skin defend itself in the presence of UVB light.References for this information:Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity, January 2019, ePublicationFood & Function, February 2018, pages 806-818Advanced in Nutrition, January 2016, pages 44-65Cosmetics, Volume 5, 2018, ePublication"

Because salicylic acid is oil soluble, it also has the ability to penetrate into the pore lining and exfoliate inside the pore. This makes it especially effective for reducing breakouts, including blackheads and whiteheads. Salicylic acid is recognized as an over-the-counter topical acne product by the U.S. FDA, when used in concentrations of 0.5-2%. Even though salicylic acid is best known for its ability to address acne-prone skin concerns, it offers many additional properties that any skin type can benefit from. Case in point, by exfoliating the buildup of dead skin on the surface, it also helps reverse the appearance of dull, uneven skin tone, as well as other visible signs of aging skin. Unlike physical exfoliants (such as a rough facial scrub), salicylic acid offers hydrating properties that enhance the result of smooth, soft skin. Another unique advantage is salicylic acid’s ability to gently soothe aggravated skin thanks to its inherent calming properties. Salicylic acids works most effectively as a leave-on treatment, ideally within a pH range between 3 and 4. Rinse-off salicylic acid cleansers typically have a higher pH, which likely won’t offer much of an exfoliation benefit—not to mention the contact time with skin is very brief—but the salicylic acid may at least offer skin-calming benefits in this form and can be included in amounts as low as 0.5% to achieve this benefit. Research shows using salicylic acid starting at a 1-2% concentration is recommended for regular exfoliation within a skin care routine. For more stubborn concerns, higher concentrations can make a dramatic difference. In dermatologic practices, salicylic acid has been safely used in as high as 50% concentrations for removal of warts, corns, pigmented lesions, and other advanced concerns. Salicylic acid has been found to be safe on all skin tones and ethnicities.

In China, the extract is known as Huang-Qin or golden herb, because the root is a golden yellow color. It’s primarily used in cosmetics for its promising ability to interrupt the creation and transfer of excess pigment; however, these scientific studies were done in vitro on skin cells, not intact skin on people struggling with dark spots, so what seems exciting in a lab setting may not hold as much promise for topical use. The other issue is the current lack of agreement on how much of this root extract is needed to visibly fade skin discolorations; some say 0.1% is enough, others recommend at least a 1% concentration is necessary, and some blends with this ingredient encourage amounts of 3-10% if the goal is visible improvement of skin color. The root is more exciting because it contains baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A, all of which are flavones, a type of antioxidant that lend color to various plants and are known to be soothing. Scutellaria baicalensis root can help skin better withstand environmental aggressors that can worsen the look of many common skin concerns, so it certainly has value. Testing on mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig skin revealed that a standardized extract of this ingredient is not irritating or sensitizing, even when the skin was compromised. The conclusion was that Scutellaria baicalensis is a viable option for sensitive skin struggling with signs of uneven skin tone or just in need of soothing.

The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients. There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone.Claims that silicones in any form cause or worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow “suffocate” skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all of the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are apparently myths or based on anecdotal evidence.Because of silicone’s unique molecular properties, they are at the same time porous and resistant though not impermeable to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released into the water. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it’s mixed with “steep” through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the “actives” to get through. The special molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they still offer protection against moisture loss.Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide.Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use. These types of cosmetic silicones are effective, inert, and versatile ingredients that benefit skin and hair in numerous ways.References for this information:International Journal of Pharmaceuticals, March 2017, pages 158-162Molecular Therapy, June 2017, pages 1342-1352 Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Global, December 2016, e1183 Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, December 2016, pages 13-20 Frontiers in Pharmacology, May 2015, ePublication International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding, May-June 2015, pages 223-230 International Journal of Toxicology, May-June 2013, pages 5S-24S Dermatology Research and Practice, October 2010, ePublication Cutis, October 2008, pages 218-284 http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/category/antiaging/34408409.html"

Depending on the extraction method (ethanol vs. cold-pressed), this seed oil is a rich source of numerous types of antioxidants known as polyphenols. Chief among them is silymarin, which contains flavonolignans. These are what’s responsible for silymarin’s soothing, reparative benefits when applied to skin. They also give this plant ingredient the ability to neutralize highly damaging hydroxyl radicals that can form when skin is exposed to UV light. Silymarin and other compounds in this seed oil can help inhibit destructive enzymes in skin’s uppermost layers that would otherwise damage collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid, leading to visibly aged skin. Silymarin and its derivative silybin have also been shown to visibly reduce dark spots. Studies have shown topical application of milk thistle can help fade discoloration from sun exposure and other sources without adverse effects. Some research indicates that extraction via ethanol is preferred because when cold-pressed, the seed oil’s silymarin content is lower; however, cold pressing releases more of the silymarin derivative silybin, which is an even more potent antioxidant and skin soother than silymarin. Either method provides a good source of alpha tocopherol (vitamin E), phospholipids, and squalene as well as polyphenols such as vanillic acid and?p-coumaric.

Stable, water-soluble derivative of ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
Helps reduce signs of aging and hyperpigmentation
Enzymes in skin convert this ingredient to pure vitamin C
Doesn’t require a low pH range to be effective
Works well with other forms of vitamin C and vitamin E

Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate Description
Sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP, for short) is a stable, water-soluble form of vitamin C made from combining ascorbic acid with a phosphate and a salt, compounds which work with enzymes in skin to cleave (split) the ingredient and release pure ascorbic acid, which is the most researched form of vitamin C.
Just like pure vitamin C, sodium ascorbyl phosphate functions as an antioxidant on and within skin. When used in higher amounts, it can be effective for brightening a dull skin tone, smoothing wrinkles, visibly firming skin, and reducing discolorations.
The usual concentration of sodium ascorbyl phosphate in skin care ranges from 0.2–3%, an effective range to help improve skin’s environmental defenses and target lines and wrinkles, especially when paired with oil-soluble vitamin E for antioxidant synergy that improves the stability of both ingredients.
A 5% concentration of sodium ascorbyl phosphate was shown in a comparative study with the same amount of ascorbic acid to have equivalent wrinkle-smoothing and elasticity-increasing benefit to skin around the eyes.
Amounts above 3% are considered necessary to target discolorations, similar to the range research has shown ascorbic acid works within to target this concern.
There is also research showing amounts of 1% and 5% concentrations of sodium ascorbyl phosphate can influence factors linked to breakouts, likely due to its skin soothing effect. Thus, this form of vitamin C may be an effective adjunct to anti-acne products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.
Along with other forms of vitamin C, it is considered safe as used in skin care products. This versatile form of vitamin C works in both water- and oil-based formulas without breaking down, but despite this impressive stability, packaging is still important. This is because such stability isn’t impenetrable, meaning ongoing exposure to light and air can still weaken its efficacy, although certainly not as quickly as occurs with pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid).

It shares the same benefits as hyaluronic acid, including its remarkable ability to help skin retain a lot of moisture - one gram (or 0.03 oz.) of hyaluronic acid can hold up to six liters of water. Used on skin, it doesn’t hold that much water; instead, as a smart ingredient, sodium hyaluronate helps skin maintain water balance, which is critical to its healthy appearance. In addition to its moisture-binding (humectant) properties, sodium hyaluronate is also considered a postbiotic, meaning it can help nourish and maintain skin’s microbiome. The chief difference between hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate is that sodium hyaluronate is more bioavailable – meaning skin more readily absorbs it than hyaluronic acid. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better than hyaluronic acid, merely that many skin care products contain both forms, so your skin sees maximum benefits. Both hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate are available in different molecular weights for multi-level results (lower molecular weight can penetrate deeper into skin’s layers, where higher weights deliver immediate results on the surface).

Sodium Hydroxide Description
Sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, is a highly alkaline (also known as “basic”) ingredient used in small amounts in cosmetics to establish and hold the pH of a product in an acidic or alkaline formula. This is seen particularly in products such as cleansers and in leave-on exfoliants, where the product’s pH needs to be held within a very specific range for maximum efficacy (between 3-4 is ideal for acid-based exfoliants, while cleansers are generally pH 4.5–6). Pure sodium hydroxide’s pH level is 13, but in cosmetics, it is only used up to pH 11.
Sodium hydroxide is seen in many applications in beauty products, such as nail cuticle solvents and hair straighteners, where it’s used in greater amounts (between 2% and 5% concentrations by weight) than in leave-on skin care products or makeup (for example, some lipsticks contain 0.25% sodium hydroxide). It’s also used as a cleansing and denaturing agent. It’s a significant skin sensitizer in concentrations of 10% or greater.

Spiraea ulmaria is also a natural source of salicylates such as salicin, and is sometimes claimed to be a natural source of the exfoliating ingredient salicylic acid. But it doesn’t work like salicylic acid on skin because the salicylates require the digestive system to become salicylic acid--this process doesn’t happen on skin, but these compounds share salicylic acid’s redness-calming benefits. This plant extract seems to inhibit an enzyme in skin (5-alpha reductase) that can trigger excess oil production. Therefore, it’s likely that meadowsweet will have a noticeable effect on skin’s surface oil for those struggling with oily skin.

Similarly, the original forms of these extracts do not have the same effect as the ingredients that are derived from them. The same is true for lactic acid, derived from milk. There is a vast difference between the extracted, pure ingredient and the original form of the source material."
sulfates,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/cleansing-agents/sulfates.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Cleansing Agents'],Good,"In cosmetics, this large group of ingredients is used mainly as cleansing agents in skincare and hair-care products; they include sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate. Many consumers are concerned of sulfates in their cosmetics products because of widespread misinformation. Sulfates are not a problem, but once organizations and companies build up fears among consumers about certain cosmetics ingredients there’s almost no going back, the damage is done.In reality there’s absolutely no research showing that sulfates are a problem in skincare or hair-care products, other than causing sensitivity, but that is also true for the sulfate-free cleansing agents that some cosmetics companies advertise and sell. And, whether or not a cleansing agent will cause sensitivity depends on the amount of sulfate and on other ingredients present in a specific formula.Following are some of the most typical unsupported comments about sulfates: “Sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers are better for hair and skin.” No research has shown that to be even remotely the case. Sulfates are supposed to be terribly drying and damaging to hair, when in fact they function no differently from the cleansing agents in sulfate-free shampoos. Almost every company that touts the fact that they don’t contain sulfates do use detergent cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate.Why those are supposedly any better for skin is never explained, and no research is ever cited—because none exists. Sometimes these companies list those ingredients as being derived from or coming from coconut to make them sound natural and, by association, better for skin—but they all end up being primarily synthetic. That doesn’t make them bad in any way; it’s just that the claims are completely disingenuous. What you need to know is that both the sulfate-free cleansing agents and the sulfate versions can be drying and sensitizing depending on the formulation and/or your skin’s own reaction. All of these cleansing agents remove oil and the gunk from styling products, which is exactly what a shampoo should do.“Sulfates in cleansers are cheap.” This one is true, but so what? Lots of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are cheap, others are expensive, which has absolutely nothing to do with quality or efficacy. The first ingredient in sulfate-free shampoos is water (about 90% water) and no other cosmetic ingredient is cheaper than that!“Sulfates are used in floor cleaners and are corrosive.” This can be true, when used in large amounts and when left on surfaces over time, but so what? Salt is used to melt ice on the roadway, but it also rusts cars, which doesn’t make salt bad; it just depends on how much you use and how long you leave it on something. This is also true for the alternative sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers as well; they can also be corrosive over time depending on how much is used and how long it is left on.“Sulfates can be sensitizing.” This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that’s NOT because it’s a sulfate; rather, it’s because of its interaction with skin."

talc,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/talc.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],Average,"Naturally occurring mineral composed of magnesium, hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon which combine to form what’s known as anhydrous (contains no water) magnesium silicate. Talc is often the main ingredient in loose and pressed face powders, powder foundations, and body powders for adults and children. It may also be used in skin care products where it serves as an absorbent. Talc is also used in some liquid foundations and concealers, where it adds opacity and contributes to the makeup’s texture. An ongoing concern with talc since the 1970s has been whether it contains asbestos fibers known as chrysotile, which pose a serious risk to lung health when inhaled. Talc can become contaminated with these fibers during the mining process because asbestos (also a naturally-occurring mineral) is found in nature in close proximity to talc. This is why the selection of talc mining sites is so important, as is screening all talc batches for the presence of asbestos fibers. The screening process mentioned above is something the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively doing with commercially-available talc-containing products for several years. They’re routinely announcing to the public which talc-containing products do and do not contain asbestos. Thankfully, the majority of such products do not contain this carcinogen and are considered safe when used as directed. Talc-containing products that testing shows do have asbestos are routinely recalled. This includes talc-based body powders from major brands like Johnson & Johnson, who’ve been subject to ongoing litigation concerning allegations of the presence of asbestos in their talc products. Consumers who remain concerned about whether the talc-containing products they use contain asbestos are advised to contact the brand and ask about batch certification testing to ensure the safety of these products. But we must acknowledge the public record the talc industry at large has of providing misleading information in order to conceal potential risk, justifying ongoing consumer skepticism. Alternately, you may wish to avoid all personal care products that contain talc and seek alternatives such as those made with other absorbents like corn starch, rice powder, silica, boron nitride, nylon-12, and responsibly-mined mica, or various other non-talc ingredients. Overall, despite ongoing controversies and legal issues, asbestos-free talc is considered safe for use in makeup and skin care, although it’s recommended to avoid applying loose powder talc in the genital area. According to the formal safety assessment completed in 2015, “Industry specifications state that cosmetic-grade talc must contain no detectable fibrous, asbestos minerals.” They go on to caution that “Talc should not be applied to the skin when the epidermal barrier is missing or significantly disrupted”, which makes sense given talc is not meant to get into the body, it is meant to stay on skin’s surface.Last Updated: March 2020References for this information:Epidemiology, November 2019, pages 783-788American Journal of Public Health, July 2019, pages 969-974JNCI Cancer Spectrum, April 2018, ePublicationRisk Analysis, May 2017, pages 918-929; and July 2016, ePublicationInternational Journal of Toxicology, July-August 2015, Supplement, pages 66S-129SEuropean Journal of Cancer Prevention, November 2011, pages 501-507; and April 2008, pages 139-146"

Oil-soluble, more stable form of vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
Known to help preserve’s skin collagen
Neutralizes free radicals that would otherwise damage skin’s lipids
Must be formulated at a pH below 6.5 when used in water-based formulas
Also known as THD ascorbate

Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate Description
Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THD) is a highly stable form of vitamin C that is considered an analogue of L-ascorbic acid. Enzymes within skin convert this form of vitamin C to pure vitamin C, ascorbic acid.
Unlike pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid), tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is lipid (fat) soluble. As such, it can penetrate further into skin where it works with vitamin E (tocopherol) that’s naturally in your skin or in skin care products to target skin’s underlying support system via a different pathway than water-soluble ascorbic acid.
Some researchers theorize that tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate has a greater affinity for skin because its fatty acid component helps aid penetration. It pairs well with other forms of vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea, and retinol for enhanced effectiveness and anti-aging benefits.
Its oil-soluble nature lets it neutralize the types of free radicals that damage skin’s lipids such as ceramides and cholesterol. This is primarily how it works as an antioxidant, while the water-soluble ascorbic acid helps neutralize other types of free radicals before they get too far past skin’s surface.
Concentration-wise, amounts of 0.1% have antioxidant benefit, and it is often used at this level and up to 2% for maintaining skin health plus visibly soothing environmentally distressed skin.
If the goal is targeting hyperpigmentation, research shows amounts of 5% or greater are necessary for best results. It’s most effective when formulated at a pH of 6 or below and may be used with other discoloration-reducing ingredients such as niacinamide and licorice root where it’s been shown to deliver synergistic results. In fact, a 30% concentration of THD used with other discoloration-reducing ingredients was shown to improve stubborn hyperpigmentation and was even suitable for melasma-prone skin.
Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate has a slightly oily feel and may be colorless to pale yellow in appearance, depending on the supplier. It can be used in water-based formulas but must be combined with silicones or oils for ideal bioavailability.
Despite inherent stability, it’s not impervious to eventual degradation from ongoing exposure to light and strong sources of heat (above 113 degrees Fahrenheit/45 degrees Celsius). For this reason, we advise avoiding products with this ingredient packaged in jars or transparent materials.
Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is considered safe as used in cosmetics in concentrations up to 30% even when used with retinol, a 10% concentration of ascorbic acid, and other bio-active ingredients.

Used as a thickening, opacifying, pigment, and sunscreen ingredient
Protects against both UVA and UVB rays
Gentle enough even for sensitive, redness-prone skin
Deemed safe as used in cosmetics products

Titanium Dioxide Description
Titanium dioxide is an inert earth mineral used as a thickening, opacifying, and sunscreen ingredient in cosmetics. It protects skin from UVA and UVB radiation and is considered non-risky in terms of of skin sensitivity. Because it is gentle, titanium dioxide is a great sunscreen active for sensitive, redness-prone skin. It’s great for use around the eyes, as it is highly unlikely to cause stinging.
There are two primary forms of titanium dioxide commercially available: anatase and rutile. The rutile form is typically used in sunscreens due to its superior ability to handle UV rays and stability in the presence of UV light. The anatase form is typically used in other types of products, such as paint. Another plus of the rutile form is that its UVA protection extends past 400 nanometers, which is the upper limit of UVA.
Titanium dioxide is typically micronized and coated for use in cosmetics products. The micronizing makes this somewhat heavy-feeling ingredient easier to spread on skin, plus a bit more cosmetically elegant. Micronized titanium dioxide is much more stable and can provide better sun protection than non-micronized titanium dioxide.
Micronized titanium dioxide doesn't penetrate skin so there’s no need to be concerned about it getting into your body. Even when titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used, the molecular size of the substance used to coat the nanoparticles is large enough to prevent them from penetrating beyond the uppermost layers of skin. This means you’re getting the sun protection titanium dioxide provides with no risk of it causing harm to skin or your body.
The coating process improves application, enhances sun protection, and prevents the titanium dioxide from interacting with other ingredients in the presence of sunlight, thus enhancing its stability. It not only makes this ingredient much more pleasant to use for sunscreen, but also improves efficacy and eliminates safety concerns. Common examples of ingredients used to coat titanium dioxide are alumina, dimethicone, silica, and trimethoxy capryl silane.
Titanium dioxide as used in sunscreens is commonly modified with other ingredients to ensure efficacy and stability. Examples of what are known as surface modifier ingredients used for titanium dioxide include stearic acid, isostearic acid, polyhydroxystearic acid, and dimethicone/methicone copolymer.
Some websites maintain titanium dioxide is inferior to zinc oxide, another mineral sunscreen ingredient whose core characteristics are similar to those of titanium dioxide. The reality is that titanium dioxide is a great broad-spectrum SPF ingredient and is widely used in all manner of sun-protection products. What gets confusing for some consumers is trying to decipher research that ranks sunscreen ingredients by a UV spectrum graph. By most standards, broad-spectrum coverage for sunscreen ingredients is defined as one that surpasses 360 nanometers (abbreviated as “nm” - how the sun’s rays are measured). Titanium dioxide exceeds this range of protection, but depending on whose research you read, it either performs as well as or slightly below zinc oxide.
It’s true that titanium dioxide does not rank as high for UVA protection as zinc oxide, it ends up being a small difference (think about it like being 10 years old versus 10 years and 3 months old). This is not easily understood in terms of other factors affecting how sunscreen actives perform (such as the base formula), so many, including some dermatologists, assume that zinc oxide is superior to titanium dioxide for UVA protection. When carefully formulated, titanium dioxide provides excellent UVA protection. Its UVA protection peak is lower than that of zinc oxide, but both continue to provide protection throughout the UVA range for the same amount of time.
One final note: titanium dioxide comes in the form of a white powder and is sometimes used in cosmetics to adjust a color to a lighter shade. This is also why it can produce a white cast when used in mineral-only sunscreen formulas.

The name of one of four forms of vitamin E
Tocopherols can be either naturally occurring or synthetically derived
Offers significant antioxidant properties, including defense from pollution
Works as a supporting ingredient to help stabilize vitamin C

Tocopherol Description
Tocopherol is the name given to one of four forms of vitamin E. These four forms are d-alpha-tocopherol, d-alpha-tocopherol acetate, dl-alpha tocopherol, and dl-alpha tocopherol acetate. The “d” prefix indicates that the product was derived from natural sources, such as vegetable oils or wheat germ; whereas the “dl” prefix indicates that the vitamin was created from a synthetic base.
Research has shown that natural forms of vitamin E are more effective than their synthetic counterparts, but both have antioxidant activity. You’ll most commonly find vitamin E listed as tocopherol or tocopheryl acetate on the ingredient list.
Vitamin E is a naturally occurring component of healthy skin, and its second most prevalent antioxidant behind ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It offers significant antioxidant properties to help defend from pollution and other environmental stressors that would otherwise weaken skin, causing unwanted changes.
In skin care formulas, vitamin E also works as a good supporting ingredient. For instance, in vitamin C products, vitamin E will donate a key electron that vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) needs to stabilize itself. Vitamin E also works well with other antioxidants such as rosemary, ferulic acid, and the amino acid taurine.
Claims of using vitamin E to prevent scarring when skin is wounded haven’t yet been confirmed by published scientific research.
Vitamin E (tocopherol) can visibly improve hyperpigmentation when used in a 1% concentration. Typically, lower amounts are used in skin care for antioxidant benefit and to help preserve the stability of delicate ingredients.
Tocopherol as used in skin care is almost always supplied as an oil, since it is derived from sources like soy, rice bran, or flax oils, among others. It has a characteristic yellow to gold or even light brown color and subtle odor. However, depending on the supplier, tocopherol may also be clear (transparent) to pale yellow. It will oxidize and become darker in color from exposure to air and light.

Topically applied, it works by interrupting at least two pathways in skin that if left unchecked can lead to discolorations (e.g. dark spots, brown/gray patches). It is even suitable for melasma-prone skin. Tranexamic acid also appears to work within skin’s surface layers to make it less susceptible to UV light exposure, which ultimately helps skin retain its youthful appearance (though of course, sunscreen is still necessary for adequate protection). Double-blind and comparative research has shown that topical tranexamic acid in amounts between 2-5% rivals the results of over-the-counter concentrations of hydroquinone, long considered the gold standard for fading skin discolorations. Comparative studies also indicate tranexamic acid has greater tolerability than hydroquinone. Studies show consistent application of tranexamic acid is safe, and with topical concentrations between 2-5%, results typically show after two to three months of consistent use. Research also shows tranexamic acid may help reduce certain types of sensitivity-induced redness in skin. Note: Because tranexamic acid is a water-soluble ingredient, it works best in skin care products with oil-soluble ingredients (such as tocopherol or plant oils) designed to improve its penetration into skin. A new derivative of tranexamic acid known as cetyl tranexamate mesylate also shows promise for a reducing dark spots and redness. However, more research is needed before this can be assessed as thoroughly as tranexamic acid. It’s worth mentioning that tranexamic acid is sometimes prescribed for oral use in low doses to manage signs of melasma.

In addition to being a food seasoning, turmeric has numerous health benefits whether consumed orally vis foods and supplements or applied topically. Ongoing research has shown turmeric and the curcumin it contains play a safe and compelling role in promoting healthier, normalized skin. On skin, in vivo research has shown that turmeric and its derivatives interrupt signaling in surface cells that trigger signs of irritation. Turmeric helps calm skin and may even play a role in reducing the look of acne-related redness by modulating pathways to restore a healthier, more even appearance. Research has conclusively shown that turmeric is a potent antioxidant, largely due to its curcumin content (although turmeric also contains other antioxidants). Applying turmeric to skin can help offset signs of environmental damage and, to some extent, thwart the skin-damaging effects from UVB light. As with many antioxidants, turmeric requires protection from air and light, as routine exposure causes it to break down and limits its availability to skin. Beyond being an antioxidant, some research has shown the curcumin portion of turmeric boosts skin’s hyaluronic acid content, meaning turmeric can also be considered hydrating.

Ubiquinone Description
Ubiquinone is also (and perhaps more popularly) known as coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10. It is a vitamin-like, fat-soluble substance naturally present in the body. Applied to skin, it can have antioxidant benefits due to its energizing effect on factors in skin that tend to slow down with age and cumulative sun exposure.
There are also studies showing that environmental factors deplete the presence of ubiquinone in the skin. Topical application has been shown to have skin-soothing effects and recent research suggests its inclusion in skin care products can have a noticeable impact on the visible signs of aging.
Since ubiquinone is a large molecule, it is not known to penetrate past the uppermost layers of skin; however, this is what’s believed to help make it so effective in its role of thwarting visible effects of environmental damage.
Its effective usage level in skin is typically between 0.02–0.05%. Amounts of 1% or more tend to impart a strong yellow color to skin care formulas, as its natural color ranges from orange to dark red. It is considered non-irritating as used in cosmetics.

Nonetheless, UVA radiation creates serious cumulative changes in skin that may be far greater than the sunburn caused by UVB radiation. Research has shown that unprotected exposure to UVA rays can, within one week, create distinct injury. Research also indicates UVA exposure is even more damaging than we once knew: it seems that when UVA radiation hits skin, it not only penetrates to skin’s lower layers but the damage “bounces back” like light reflecting from a mirror, giving every layer of your skin a double-whammy of damage. UVA radiation prompts tanning, yes, but the tan you see is direct evidence of your skin responding, as best it can, to the onslaught of damage it just endured.To be truly effective and beneficial for skin, sunscreens must protect skin from both the sun’s UVA and UVB radiation. In the United States, there are four ingredients approved by the FDA that protect across the full UVA range: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone (also called Parsol 1789 and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane)."

Applying vitamin K to the surface of the skin won't improve the look of unevenness or dark circles. This type of vitamin K is also referred to as vitamin K1.
A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology (April 2004, page 73) examined the effect of applying a gel containing 2% vitamin K plus 0.1% retinol, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Fifty-seven adults with dark circles participated in this 8-week study and the results, while not a slam-dunk, weren't exactly discouraging either: 47% of the testers noted ""fair to moderate"" improvement in their dark circles. 
The majority of testers noticed no change, but the ingredient was well-tolerated. As encouraging as this seems, whether or not the results were from the vitamin K or the other vitamins is unknown.
A minimum 1% concentration of vitamin K1 has been shown in animal studies to positively influence wound healing by hastening the natural process damaged skin undergoes as it works to repair itself. It is not known if this principle would apply to intact skin showing signs of aging. 
The same concentration of vitamin K1 was used in another study to test its results on improving the look of dark circles. Although some improvement was noted, the formula in testing also contained caffeine and emu oil, although the study’s authors concluded that the dark circle benefits were solely attributed to vitamin K.
Interestingly, despite somewhat encouraging research, we rarely see products that contain (or are likely to contain) the amounts of vitamin K research has shown can be beneficial.

Only a 10% concentration of water in the outer layer of skin is necessary for softness and pliability in this part of the epidermis. Studies that have compared the water content of dry skin with that of normal or oily skin do not find a statistically significant difference in moisture levels between them.
Further, too much water can be a problem for skin because it can disrupt the essential substances in skin's surface layers that keep it intact, smooth, and healthy-looking. As an example, recall how skin on your fingers and toes ""prunes"" when you soak in the bathtub or other body of water for too long.

However, witch hazel’s high tannin content (tannin is a potent antioxidant) can also make it sensitizing if used repeatedly on skin because it denatures proteins that help keep skin healthy. The bark of the witch hazel plant has a higher tannin content than the leaves, which contain other compounds, including beneficial antioxidants. Producing witch hazel water by steam distillation removes the tannins and can circumvent the need to use skin-damaging alcohol (ethanol), but the plant’s astringent qualities are what most believe give it benefit. But using water or steam distillation rather than alcohol is one way to obtain a gentler form of this ingredient for occasional use; it just doesn't make witch hazel problem-free, so we don't advise using it on skin often. Alcohol added during the distillation process is typically used in amounts of 14–15%. That's more than enough to damage skin, as research has shown amounts as low as 2% can harm skin cells. Witch hazel water is distilled from all parts of the plant; therefore, you never know exactly what you’re getting, although the alcohol content remains since this form of witch hazel either uses alcohol during distillation or it is added afterward to enhance penetration of the witch hazel water. Summing up, depending on the form of witch hazel, you’re exposing your skin either to a sensitizing amount of alcohol or to tannins, or both. Moreover, witch hazel contains the fragrance chemical eugenol, which is another source of sensitivity.

In the plant world, xylitol naturally occurs in many fruits and vegetables, including mushrooms, lettuce, strawberries, bananas, and yellow plums. Research has shown that, like the skin-replenishing ingredient glycerin, xylitol hydrates and helps strengthen skin’s barrier. Xylitol also has an influential role in normalizing skin and the natural process keratinocytes (skin cells) go through as they work their way from the lower to the upper layers to the surface. Part of this is due to its ability to squelch damaging factors in skin that would otherwise throw skin’s natural processes off track. Xylitol is considered a nutritive sweetener and when added to foods or foods that naturally contain xylitol are eaten, research has shown it has prebiotic action that positively influences the gut microbiome. Xylitiol is a source of galactooligosaccharides, which are primary responsible for its prebiotic ability.

There is little research showing this to be beneficial for skin. The information that is available shows that it can be a skin sensitizer when used in large amounts. A small amount of zinc sulfate is sometimes used in high-strength vitamin C treatments to stabilize the vitamin C (typically seen on the ingredient list as ascorbic acid). In these instances, the zinc sulfate is unlikely to be a source of skin sensitivity."
