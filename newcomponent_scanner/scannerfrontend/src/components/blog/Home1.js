    <h1>Ingredients Newly Explained</h1><br></br>
    <h3>PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate</h3>
    <p>An emollient liquid that usually comes to the formula combined with C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate and Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate as the trio works in synergy to solubilize hard to dissolve sunscreen agents while providing a nice, non-greasy skin feel. </p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate</h3>
    <p>Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer is a big molecule created from repeating subunits (aka polymer) used as a film-former. It is great at improving the water and wear resistance of sunscreens and makeup products. </p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate</h3>
    <p>An oily liquid that makes your skin nice and smooth (aka emollient). It is also claimed to have some humectant and moisturizing properties without a greasy after-feel. But its real superpower is being an outstanding solvent for hard to solubilize sunscreen agents (that is most of the chemical sunscreen filters) making it an excellent emollient choice in high SPF products.  </p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Sodium Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonate</h3>
    <p>The salt form of the water-soluble chemical sunscreen, Ensulizole. What we wrote there (UVB filter with a peak protection at 306 nm), applies here as well. In fact, the pure acid form (aka Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid) can be incorporated into a sunscreen formula only if it is neutralized with a base (otherwise it is not water-soluble), so even if the acid form in on the ingredient list, what you have in the formula is a salt form, just like this one.  </p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Ethylhexyl Dimethyl PABA</h3>
    <p>Ethylhexyl Dimethyl PABA is a chemical sunscreen agent that protects in the UVB range (290-320 nm) with a peak absorbance at 312nm. Other than that, we struggle to write anything positive about this guy, as it is photo unstable (looses 10% efficacy in 20 mins and 50% in 85 mins), not an unfrequent allergen in sunscreens and shows some endocrine effect in animal studies. All this does not mean that it is not considered safe as used, it is (and is approved up to 8% in the EU and US and up to 3% in Japan), but we do think that there are plenty of other and better UV filters out there.  </p>
    <h3>Rosa Damascena Flower Oil</h3>
    <p>We are big fans of all kinds of roses as ornamental plants but when it comes to skincare, it is a mixed bag. Before we list out the good and the not so good, here is an interesting thing. The oil content in rose is very, very low so distilling rose essential oil requires huge amounts of rose flowers. It has such a wonderful scent that there are no comparable synthetic alternatives. You can probably guess that this means rose essential oil is expensive.... very very expensive.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7</h3>
    <p>A four amino acid peptide with the amino sequence of glycine-glutamine-proline-arginine. It is attached to palmitic acid (a fatty acid)  to increase oil solubility and skin penetration. It works by reducing the production of the signal molecule, interleukin-6 (IL-6) which promotes inflammation in the skin and less inflammation means slower degradation of important things (like collagen) that results in younger looking skin for a longer time.   </p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Gluconolactone</h3>
    <p>Gluconolactone is kind of an acid, even though you would probably not guess it from its name. It’s a PHA, or polyhydroxy acid. PHAs are close relatives to the famous AHAs, both in terms of similar chemical structure and similar effects on the skin. They are often marketed as new-generation AHAs. So if AHAs do not tell you anything, you can read all about them here. Go and read. We tell you, it’s worth the time. </p>
